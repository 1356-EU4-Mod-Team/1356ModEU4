 GAS_secure_navarra_desc: "The ruling Family of Navarra have in the past stopped at nothing to get what they wanted.

 GAS_annex_aragon_catalonia_title: "Annex Aragon"
 GAS_annex_aragon_catalonia_desc: "Now that we control roughly 3/4th's of the Pyrenee Mountains it couldn't hurt to take the rest of it.

 GAS_form_aquitaine_desc: "While we Gascons are a proud people, if we are to stand against the French and English then we will need the help of the other cultural minorities in the south of France.

 GAS_take_brittany_title: "Annex Brittany"
 GAS_take_brittany_desc: "While the Bretons are equally as hated by the French, allying such a small Duchy would do little to further our goal. They'd serve us better as loyal Dukes to the King of Gascony!"

 GAS_take_loire_desc: "The Loire region is very rich and is a key part of the French Kingdom. Without it we not only starve the French, but we also starve them of any income they may have. If we take the Loire then we stab a knife into the back of the French dogs!"

 GAS_take_normandy_desc: "Normandy has always been contested within France, it also happens to consist of a large portion of the French Coastline. If we wish to choke the life out of the French, preventing them access to the sea through Normandy would do just that."

 GAS_take_valois_picardie_champagne_desc: "This is it! The last push before we take the tyrant Kings of France down!

 GAS_take_tunis_title: "Conquer Tunis"

 GAS_annex_toulouse_title: "Annex Toulouse"
 GAS_annex_toulouse_desc: "The County of Toulouse has always been contested between the Dukes of Aquitaine and Gascony. Previously the King of France awarded it to the Duke of Aquitaine, leaving nothing for us! Now that we are free it is only right if we take it back for ourselves!"

 GAS_annex_rest_of_gascon_kingdom_desc: "Historically, the provinces of Saintonge and Angoumois were both part of the Duchy of Gascony. However in recent history they were stripped away from us! Since we are near our goal of uniting the former Duchy of Gascony it is only right to take all of it!"

 ###Start Swiss Missions###
 zur_appease_cantons_title:0 "Appease the Cantons"
 zur_appease_cantons_desc:0 "The Old Swiss Confederacy has grown in the past years, but there is always room for more growth. However, in order to expand, we must first resolve our internal issues. We'll need to make sure our cantons don't rebel - or else!"
 zur_control_thurgau_title:0 "The Canton of Thurgau"
 zur_control_thurgau_desc:0 "The Austrians have the audacity to expand into Swiss territory! We need to act quickly to prevent them from expanding further into the Swiss nucleus, and the best means of doing so is subjugating their vassal of Thurgau."
 zur_make_bern_canton_title:0 "The Canton of Bern"
 zur_make_bern_canton_desc:0 "Bern is a member of the Confederacy, but has enjoyed certain privileges that other members don't. Bern's interests often clash with other cantons, and because of its increased autonomy there's not much we can do. Because of this, we should subjugate them and make sure that they don't fall out of line anymore."
 zur_vaud_canton_title:0 "The Canton of Vaud"
 zur_vaud_canton_desc:0 "Our efforts to expand within the heartland of Switzerland have succeeded, but Switzerland alone is not enough. Let's expand into the territory of our rivals in Savoy, and establish a new canton - the canton of Vaud."
 zur_conquer_fribourg_title:0 "All Bark and No Bite"
 zur_conquer_fribourg_desc:0 "The Duchy of Fribourg to the north of us like to raid our borders and insult our people. This will simply not do. As much as they like to talk down upon the Swiss people, they themselves would crumble even for a minor tremor. It's time to discipline them."
 zur_decrease_canton_privleges_title:0 "Revoke Canton Privleges"
 zur_decrease_canton_privleges_desc:0 "The cantons have proved to be quite a challenge to handle in their sheer numbers. It is in our best interest to take measures to limit their independence so that we don't have to deal with rebellions."
 zur_sempacherbrief_title:0 "Create the Sempacherbrief"
 zur_sempacherbrief_desc:0 "The Sempacherbrief, a document meant to unite and create mutual benefit among the Swiss cantons has been created. Let us issue this document so that our cantons are less wary of us."
 zur_sundgau_title:0 "End the Habsburgs in Switzerland"
 zur_sundgau_desc:0 "Sundgau is the last bastion of Habsburg rule in Southern Germany. It is an isolated, hideous hideout that serves no purpose but to keep a tighter grip on us. Let's show these Austrian snakes who's really in charge of Southern Germany!"
 zur_milan_title:0 "Expansion Into Italy"
 zur_milan_desc:0 "With our position on the crossroads between Germany and Italy, it is only natural that we expand into one of the two, and frankly, Italy has the better land. The first obstacle is Milan, but it's no obstacle we can't overcome."
 zur_weather_reformation_title:0 "Deal With the Reformation"
 zur_weather_reformation_desc:0 "The Protestant Reformation has the potential to tear our country apart, we need to act quickly. Making sure that the cantons are either tolerated or are all our religion is of the upmost priority."
 zur_unite_switzerland_title:0 "Unify Switzerland!"
 zur_unite_switzerland_desc:0 "The time has come to unify the Swiss people under one flag! (NOTE: You'll lose the Zurich missions and gain the Swiss missions instead. Only do this if you're ready.)"
 zur_anti_austria_title:0 "Anti-Austrian Rhetoric"
 zur_anti_austria_desc:0 "The Austrian snakes have the audacity to expand into Swiss land, claiming it as their own. We are a proud people, and cannot tolerate such nonsense. We need to give them a piece of our mind!"
 zur_fortify_zurich_title:0 "Fortify Zurich"
 zur_fortify_zurich_desc:0 "The Habsburgs could attack at any time! You've got some walls already, but you should build more as soon as you have enough stone." 
 zur_rent_out_mercs_title:0 "Rent Out Mercenaries"
 zur_rent_out_mercs_desc:0 "Mercenaries are the backbone of any good military. Our Swiss mercenaries are roaming Europe, looking for the best buyer."
 zur_swiss_guard_title:0 "The Swiss Guard"
 zur_swiss_guard_desc:0 "To protect the Pope is to protect Christendom itself. Truly we are blessed today as the Pope himself invites our soldiers to be his personal guard."
 zur_dev_plan_title:0 "The Development Plan"
 zur_dev_plan_desc:0 "In order to build a greater Switzerland, our cities need to be urbanized. The small villages in the valleys of the alps are not enough to sustain the Confederacy. In order to keep up with the more major powers, we will need to upgrade our towns."
 zur_develop_wallis_title:0 "Working With Wallis"
 zur_develop_wallis_desc:0 "Our canton of Wallis lies on the border of Savoy, and we cannot look bad to our main rival. Urbanizing the towns in Wallis are of the upmost importance."
 zur_develop_vaud_title:0 "Venues in Vaud"
 zur_develop_vaud_desc:0 "The canton of Vaud has been ravaged from wars with the Savoyards. Let's rebuild it to make it on par with our other cantons."
 zur_develop_zurich_title:0 "Zeitgeist of Zurich"
 zur_develop_zurich_desc:0 "Zurich is the core of Switzerland, but that isn't to say that it can't be made better. Let us make a capital that rivals the likes of Prague and Dijon!"
 zur_develop_waldstatte_title:0 "Workshops in Waldstatte"
 zur_develop_waldstatte_desc:0 "Waldstatte is the original nucleus of the Swiss Confederacy, but it is still a patchwork of small cities. The heart of Switzerland must function like a heart, strong and energetic."
 zur_develop_raetia_title:0 "Rigorous Work in Raetia"
 zur_develop_raetia_desc:0 "Raetia is one of the most mountainous areas in the Swiss Confederacy, but that isn't to say it can't be improved. With hard work, the mountains can be turned into mines and the valleys into farmland."
 zur_develop_bern_title:0 "Building up Bern"
 zur_develop_bern_desc:0 "Bern is a thriving city, and it's not hard to see why. Positioned in the crossroads between Switzerland and the Rhineland, Bern is in a strategic position for trade and war. Developing it is sure to bring us prestige and commerce!"
 zur_finish_dev_plan_title:0 "Dev Plan Complete!"
 zur_finish_dev_plan_desc:0 "The development plan has been finished, and Switzerland is now a thriving urban community. Let us fund one last push for public works in the heart of Switzerland to celebrate our urbanization!"
