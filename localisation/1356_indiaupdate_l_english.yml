However, Stefan's reign greatly diminished Serbia's standing in the Balkans, causing our title of Tsar to become a mere laughingstock.

After days of fierce debate from both sides, they have come to a mutual agreement: a ruler must be selected that has a strong claim to the throne as well as possess the competence to combat the Kingdoms of Hungary and Bulgaria. The council has presented the following candidates: Vukasin Mrnjavcevic and Nikephoros II of Epirus. Vukasin was one of Stefan Dusan's greatest generals and some of the nobles argue his experience in war is essential in dealing with Hungary and Bulgaria. Nikephoros is known throughout the realm for his stewardship over Epirus. Some lords are arguing that Serbia is in desperate need of his administrative skills. On the other hand, offering the throne to the Kotromanics of Bosnia would unite Serbian and Bosnian lands under one banner and provide crucial support against Hungary and Bulgaria.

 zoroastrianflavuor.16.d: "$MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has ordered the construction of a Atash Behram here in $CAPITAL_CITY$. Since the Arab invasion of Persia in 633, many of these sacred temples have been destroyed or converted into Mosques, along with a majority of Zoroastrian followers being executed or forced converted to Islam. Since the fall of the Sassanian Empire in 654, the world has lacked a strong central state who openly practices Zoroastrianism, however for the first time since the fall of the Sassanids, $MONARCH$ has managed to recreate a strong Zoroastrian state. With the construction of a new Atash Behram Temple, we can reaffirm all Zoroastrians of the World that our faith is still strong!"
