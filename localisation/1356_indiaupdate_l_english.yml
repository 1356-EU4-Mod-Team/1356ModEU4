However, Stefan's reign greatly diminished Serbia's standing in the Balkans, causing our title of Tsar to become a mere laughingstock.

The council has presented the following candidates: Vukasin Mrnjavcevic and Nikephoros II of Epirus. Vukasin was one of Stefan Dusan's greatest generals and some of the nobles argue his experience in war is essential in dealing with Hungary and Bulgaria. Nikephoros is known throughout the realm for his stewardship over Epirus. Some lords are arguing that Serbia is in desperate need of his administrative skills. On the other hand, offering the throne to the Kotromanics of Bosnia would unite Serbian and Bosnian lands under one banner and provide crucial support against Hungary and Bulgaria. But Crowning Anka Basarab, wife of Stefan Uros, as queen could lead to closer ties with Wallachia."

 zoroastrian_atash_behram_desc: "Atash Behram, the 'Fire of Victory' is the highest grade of Holy fire in Zoroastrianism. Since the Arab invasion of Persia many ancient temples holding these sacred fires have since been destroyed. Building one in our Capital would reaffirm that the Zoroastrian faith is still strong, despite many centuries of persecution." 
 zoroastrianflavuor.16.t: "The $CAPITAL_CITY$ Atash Behram"
 zoroastrianflavuor.16.d: "$MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has ordered the construction of a Atash Behram here in $CAPITAL_CITY$. Since the Arab invasion of Persia in 633, many of these sacred temples have been destroyed or converted into Mosques, along with a majority of Zoroastrian followers being executed or forced converted to Islam. Since the fall of the Sassanian Empire in 654, the world has lacked a strong central state who openly practices Zoroastrianism. With the construction of the new Atash Behram Temple, we can strengthen the faith of those who still practice Zoroastrianism."
