 BT_NAME: "§TBarbarossa's Throne§!"
 BT_DESC: "The year is 1356 and the German emperor Friedrich III. is about to publish the Golden Bull, which could mean the end of the old power structure in the empire. Although the central power is stronger than ever through the crusades of Friedrich I. and II. there is resistance. Due to the fights between the Seljuqs and Mongols, the Byzantine Emperor Justinian III. managed to stabilise the eastern border and prepares to reconquer Central Anatolia. The rise of the Crusader States after the successful third crusade has made them more and more uncontrollable for the west. In Western Europe, the hundred years war rages on, and the last remnants of the Yuan Dynasty fight a brutal civil war in the east. Who will be able to enforce his interests? §TBarbarossa's Throne is an Alternate History Scenario set in the year 1356.§!"
 barbarossa.1.t: "Welcome to Barbarossa's Throne"
 barbarossa.1.d: "This start event gives you the opportunity to get to know the 4 major parties of Barbarossa's Throne. You can read about the history of those four countries or start directly..."

 barbarossa.1.adu: "Tell me about Al-Andalus!"
 barbarossa.1.koj: "Tell me about the Kingdom of Jerusalem!"
 barbarossa.1.done: "Allright, we can start!"
 barbarossa.2.t: "The German Empire"
 barbarossa.2.d: "Since the regency of Friedrich I, the Holy Roman Empire went through a huge development. After the successful third crusade against Saladin in 1190, in the Dome of the Rock, he crowned himself to the King of Jerusalem. Strengthened by this massive success, he managed to limit the power of clergy and princes in favour of the central power. The German Empire was transferred from an elective monarchy into a hereditary monarchy and all clergy lands were put under the emperor's control again. Therefore at the end of his reign, Barbarossa became the spiritual head of the German church. His last significant decision was the appointment of a permanent German Capital, which became the imperial city of Frankfurt. His successors could not expand his achievement but preserve it. Friedrich II. left the Kingdom of Jerusalem to his son Konrad IV, to ensure control of the external possession. After the fourth crusade also brought some results in the Southern Levant, the Kingdom of Jerusalem acts more and more independent and defy control. At Christmas 1356, the new emperor Friedrich III tries to stipulate the current distribution of power by passing the Golden Bull, but the northern rulers oppose against this edict. The unity of Germany probably will be decided by the sword..."
 barbarossa.3.t: "The Byzantine Empire"
 barbarossa.3.d: "The Byzantine Empire is the successor state of the Eastern Roman Empire. The Empire got its name from the capital Byzanz which was renamed later as Constantinople. In the late antiquity, the Byzantine Empire expanded its power in the Eastern Mediterranean and gained control over a large part of the former Roman Empire. The territorial expansion was stopped by internal conflicts. Beside an empty treasury, the eastern church declared itself as independent from Constantinople. While the empire was successful in the west an energy-sapping conflict with Persia in the east weakened the Empire. Persia and the Byzantine Empire were both weakened since the 7th century, therefore, the Muslims managed to conquer many territories and both empires stood on the edge of an abyss. Unlike the Persians, the Byzantine Empire resisted successfully the early Muslim conquests. After a period of stabilisation, a period of prosperity began which ended with the invasion of the Seljuks. The empire only avoided the downfall with help from the Crusaders. Due to a feud between noble families, the empire was thrown into a civil war which ended with the rose of the Laskaris to power many years later. The invasion of the Mongolian tribes into east Anatolia severely weakened the influence of Rum which in its turn helped to maintain the Byzantine influence during the civil war. But they both are not satisfied with the status quo..."
 barbarossa.4.t: "The Empire of Al-Andalus"
 barbarossa.4.d: "The Muslim Empire of Al-Andalus arose since 711 on the height of the early Muslim conquests. After the defeat against Abd Allah ibn Ali, the power fall to the Abbasids and the old ruling family was brutally traced and murdered. Prince Adr ar-Rahmen managed to escape and founded the Emirate of Cordoba on the Iberian Peninsula. He established control over the Peninsula and built the Great Mosque of Cordoba. Motivated by disloyal vassals in North Spain, Charlemagne sallied out for a crusade against Cordoba. On his way, he was surprised by revolts in Saxony and cancelled the crusade. On the way back the Basque took revenge for their demolition of Pamplona and inflicted high casualties on his army. In a later war, he was more successful, which led to the formation of the Marca Hispanica. Thenceforth it was a buffer between Christian Europe and the Muslim Iberia. A time of internal conflicts between Arabs order Berbers followed, which were finally solved by Abd ar-Rahman III. who proclaimed himself caliph. After this, a cultural and economical time of prosperity began, which continued under his successors Al-Hakam II. and Hisham II. At last, the Christian principalities in the north failed with a common campaign and fell into dispute, which broke their coalition. This opens the door for further conquests in Europe..."
 barbarossa.5.t: "The Kingdom of Jerusalem"
 barbarossa.5.d: "The Kingdom of Jerusalem now exists for more than 250 years and represents the largest Crusader State in the Levant. It was founded in 1099 after the conquest by Godfrey of Bouillon and Raymond IV. However, since none of them wanted the royal title of Jerusalem the Kingdom was created only in 1100 with the coronation of Baldwin I. Due to the distance from Europe and the limited contingents of soldiers, it was necessary to cooperate with locals. Until the death of his son Baldwin II, the kingdom could be enlarged and stabilised. Under his successors, it came to a massive loss of Power, which was used by the Ayyubid ruler Saladin, who conquered the city of Jerusalem in 1187. This caused the Third Crusade, on which Richard I of England and Friedrich Barbarossa took part. On their way to the Holy Land, Richard I drowned in the Saleph, a river in Cilician Armenia. Despite this Barbarossa successfully led the Army to Jerusalem, whose Kingdom could be restored to its former extent. At the end of the Crusade, he crowned himself to the King of Jerusalem. After his death, his second successor Friedrich II appointed his son Konrad IV as the new King of Jerusalem to achieve better control over the Levant. The latter could extend his power, which led to that under his successors, the Kindom of Jerusalem defects more and more..."
