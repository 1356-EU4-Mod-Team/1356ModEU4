 desc_radical_bible_reform_aspect: "Some Hussites wanted to just resolve problems within the Catholic Church, however other more Radical Hussite parties wanted to change many parts of the faith, including parts of the bible.

Joan of Arc herself wrote a letter to the Bohemians threatening to lead an army against them, but she was captured by the English and Burgundians before she could do anything."

According to traditional stories these Nestorians came to be due to the influence of St Thomas himself, however there are records of there being Korchin Jews as early as the 1st century, so it is possible that St. Thomas may have arrived there and actually influenced these Jews to his views. This small region is one of the larger pockets of Nestorians in the Far East. "
