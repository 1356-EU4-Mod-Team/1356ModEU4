 string_start_england:0 "In [GetYear] the Kingdom of §YEngland§! holds the upper hand in the war against §YFrance§!. After defeating a numerically superior French army at the Battle of Poitiers, the English now hold the French king §YJean II§! and his son Philippe the Bold captive, leaving the Dauphin §YCharles§! as regent.\n\nThis phase of the war has gone well for the English. After the Black Death brought the war to a halt for the previous few years, the campaign has been renewed once more by King §YEdward III§!'s son, §YEdward 'The Black Prince'§!, who in 1355 led a series of devastating raids across the south of France, known as 'chevauchée'. The chevauchée have destroyed hundreds of villages, towns, cities and castles, and the pillaging done to the agricultural infrastructure of the region has left the countryside utterly desolated. The French economy is in ruins, and local nobles have proven unwilling to come to the aid of their subjects, leaving much of the peasantry agitated.\n\nAlong with the terrible destruction has come great benefit to the Anglo and §YGascon§! invaders. The devestation of the French land and army has allowed the English to occupy large swathes of France and are now perfectly positioned to encroach further on Paris, or secure the southern cities of Narbonne and Montpellier. Regardless of the direction of future occupation, the strong position the English find themselves in means that they are almost sure to achieve victory, and most likely make demands of territorial concessions to their Gascon allies.\n\nAcross the Channel it is also smooth sailing. The §YScottish§! threat has been neutralised for the time being after the capture of the King of Scots, §YDaibhid II§! at the Battle of Neville's Cross. The lords in §YWales§!, §YNorthumberland§!, §YLancaster§! and §YKildare§! have stayed content, although how long their current autonomy will be upheld remains to be seen. The only hiccup is the increasing popularity of a new brand of heresy, Lollardism. For now however, the heretics are peaceful, and Britons can safely assume that for the coming decades if not centures, they will never be slaves."
 string_start_france:0 "In [GetYear] the Kingdom of §YFrance§! is still recovering after the disastrous Battle of Poitiers, part of the Edwardian phase of the Hundred Years’ War. King §YJean II§! and his son Phillippe the Bold have been captured alongside large swathes of the French nobility at the Battle of Poitiers, leaving heir to the throne §YCharles§! to assume the powers of regent as the government collapses around him.\n\nThis phase of the war has not gone well for the French. The §YEnglish§! are on the offensive once more, after a lull in the fighting during the previous years as the Black Death swept through Europe. The English are performing a brutal campaign of raids known as 'chevauchee', looting and pillaging in an attempt to demoralise the French people and drain the French treasury.\n\nEven if France is to push back the English advances and kick them off the continent, there are other issues facing the kingdom. The Hundred Years’ War also encompasses ‘The War of the Two Peters’, and ‘The War of Breton Succession’, civil wars in the Kingdom of §YCastile§! and the Duchy of §YBritanny§! respectively. Internal issues are rampant also, with a refusal of the Etats Generaux to co-operate with the Dauphin, and numerous autonomous lords in need of proper integration.\n\nShould the Dauphin and his successors weather the storm however, they would find themselves as one of the most powerful kingdoms in Europe, with opportunity for expansion into the Low Countries, North Italy, or even Germany, should they dare to take on the might of the  §YHoly Roman Empire§!. The possibilities for a unified France are limitless, and an ambitious monarch could go so far as to conquer Europe and once again create a French Empire, the likes of which has never been seen since the days of Charlemagne."
 string_start_title_culture_assyrian: "The Assyrians of [TAG]"
 string_start_culture_assyrian: "The §Assyrians§ are an ancient culture that has existed in §Northern Mesopotamia§ since the fall of Neo-Assyria in 609BC, Middle Assyria in 934BC, and §Old Assyria§ in 1750 BC. The Assyrian people have fought the invaders of their homeland ever since the fall of its last Kingdom, and have at times struggled, and at times prospered. However in recent years the Assyrian people have not been as lucky as they have in the past. \n\nBetween 600-1300 AD the Assyrians and the Church of Assyria were thriving under Muslim rule. Since they were not allowed to convert anyone in a Muslim country, they sent missionaries far and wide, the farthest being China. However then the §Mongolians§ invaded. \n\nAt first the §Mongolians§ were sympathetic to the Assyrians and the §Church of Assyria§ §'Nestorians'§ due to the fact the invading Mongolians saw the practice of circumcision and halal butchery violent and repulsive. Therefore the §Assyrians§ were looked at in very good light by the Mongolians. They were given special privileges and powers, and even had an Assyrian Christian appointed as governor of a region, further allowing a §Nestorian§ church to be built there. \n\nHowever, the Mongolians of the Near East converted to Islam eventually, and things went from a Golden Age to a Dark Age very quickly. Christians were pursecuted often, which lead to the local Assyrians in persecuted regions to rebel. Those who rebelled were massacred, causing the local §Assyrian§ populations to decline at a great speed. \n\nHowever, regardless of the hardships the Assyrians endured they persisted in §Northern Mesopotamia§. \n\nAs you start, the §Assyrians§ exist with no country to call their own, word is circulating that even more oppression may arrive soon in the form of §Tamerlane§, a Turkic conquerer from the Steppes north of Persia. The §Assyrians§ have persisted through worse, but things look grim."
 string_start_religion_nestorian: "The history of the §Nestorians§ are closely tied to that of the §Assyrians§ in Mesopotamia, who were the ones who initially spread §Christianity§ into the Far East & India. Most of its existance the §Nestorians§ have been ruled by rulers of other religions, but none the less its persisted. In 1356, the §Nestorians exist in large quantity across Asia. The §St. Thomas Christians§ in Korchin, the §Nestorian Chinese Church§ in Northern China, the §Nestorians in Kashgar§ in the homeland of the Uygurs, and of course the §Syriac Church§ of Assyria. There are many minorities across asia that lay unmentioned, but these are the largest groups. \n\nAs we begin, the §Nestorian Church§ is surounded by hostile religions on all sides, and the only regions it has a hold over are quickly decaying, and its entire existance is at stake."
