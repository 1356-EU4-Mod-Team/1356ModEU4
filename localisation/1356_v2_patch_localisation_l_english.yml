As traditional siege weapons such as the Trebuchet are being replaced by the ever increasingly superior Gunpowder powered Cannon, and researchers attempting to create a hand held cannon as an alternative to Melee, it is clear that warfare will soon be forever changed."

 novgorod_princes.3.desc: "While the administrative heart of Novgorod is led by its Veche Council, the office of Prince of Novgorod is reserved for a political figure favored by the Veche most senior members. With the recent passing of the old Prince, it is time for the selection and appointment of a new one. While previous senior council members have favored members of a powerful Russian family as a means to influence the political landscape of Russia, a local Boyar leader may instead be a better alternative for the office."

 gunpowderinventions.1.t: "The §Y[western_cannon_invention_nation.GetAdjective]§! Cannon"
 gunpowderinventions.1.d: "While European nations first experienced Gunpowder when being pushed out of the Holy lands by Muslim armies during the final crusades, it usage has remained relatively tamed across most of Western Europe. However in the lands of [western_cannon_invention_nation.GetName], the inventor [Root.western_inventor_name.GetName] from [western_cannon_invention_province.Location.GetName] has created a new design over Eastern cannons. Designed to be lighter, this variant of the Cannon would allow it to have a larger impact on battles fought in the field, something other cannons also offer, but have major drawbacks in terms of speed. While some countries may still prefer the older model, several others have already taken an interest in the [western_cannon_invention_nation.GetAdjective] Cannon."
 gunpowderinventions.3.t: "The §Y[eastern_cannon_invention_nation.GetAdjective]§! Arquebus"
 gunpowderinventions.3.d: "While cannons powered by Gunpowder can be instrumental in ending year-long sieges, an inventor named [Root.eastern_inventor_name.GetName] from the province of [eastern_cannon_invention_province.Location.GetName] has taken an interest in creating a weapon which can be used from hand. Named the Arquebus by the Inventor, this weapon allows its user to shoot metal pellets at their foes from afar akin to an arrow or bolt from the traditional Bow and Crossbow. While deadlier than the ranged weapons of old, it requires a heavier investment in resources to supply an army with these advanced weapons making it is unlikely that these weapons will take over the battlefield for the short term future."
 gunpowderinventions.5.t: "The §Y[chinese_cannon_invention_nation.GetAdjective]§! Rocket Cart"
 gunpowderinventions.5.d: "While Gunpowder Weaponry has an early history in Asia since the invention of the Fire Lance during the Jin-Song Wars in China, in the last century its usage has only increased greatly, leading to a series of innovations in the field of land artillery. One such innovation comes from an inventor named [Root.chinese_inventor_name.GetName] in the province of [chinese_cannon_invention_province.Location.GetName]. Given the name ‘Rocket Cart’ it allows for an army to bombard its foes with Rockets from a long distance. When compared to other gunpowder weapons such as the cannon, the Rocket Cart trades slow hard hitting shots for a rapid fire bombardment of Rockets that can set the field aflame."
 gunpowderinventions.7.t: "The §Y[muslim_cannon_invention_nation.GetAdjective]§! Handcannon"
 gunpowderinventions.7.d: "While Cannons powered by Gunpowder gave the Mamluks the tools to finish off the remaining Crusader Strongholds in the Holy lands proving them to be game changing weapons in Siege warfare, only until recently have a select few taken serious steps into transforming the concept of the cannon into a smaller deadly weapon in the form of a handheld weapon. An inventor named [Root.muslim_inventor_name.GetName] from the province of [muslim_cannon_invention_province.Location.GetName] has taken an interest in this concept for several years and has finally achieved a prototype. His invention has resulted in the first handheld cannon, named the ‘Handcannon’ and is the very first of its kind and perhaps the signs of various possibilities with gunpowder. Since the invention, [muslim_cannon_invention_nation.Monarch.GetTitle] [muslim_cannon_invention_nation.Monarch.GetName] has issued a royal decree, beginning production of these hand cannons and for them to be sold on the markets, and providing them to important Envoys."
 gunpowderinventions.9.t: "The §YGun of Urban§!"
 gunpowderinventions.9.d: "A Hungarian inventor by the name of Orbán who specializes in the field of Gunpowder recently arrived in [ottoman_cannon_invention_nation.GetName] where he was provided materials and funds from the [ottoman_cannon_invention_nation.GetAdjective] [ottoman_cannon_invention_nation.GovernmentName]. Through these investments, Orbán created a large artillery cannon he named the ‘Gun of Urban’ boasting that it could breach the walls of Babylon itself. While such a cannon is likely to be a liability in open battle on the field, such a cannon would be devastating when used in sieges."
 gunpowderinventions.11.t: "Indus Valley Saltpetre"
 gunpowderinventions.11.d: "The Indus Valley is home to one of the most ancient industries of Saltpetre in the world. Since the increased usage and demand of Gunpowder, these industries in the Valley have since only benefited from the increased demand of Saltpeter. It is also rumored by merchants that Indus Saltpeters can produce a unique spark unlike other Saltpeters."
 
 gunpowderinventions.22.t: "Early Siege Weaponry"
 gunpowderinventions.22.d: "During the late Medieval era, Siege weapons were crucial in affecting the flow of Warfare. While in battle, archers and crossbowmen could bombard the foe with arrows and bolt, Siege weapons could inflict mass casualties from afar and excelled in breaching fortified strongholds. As gunpowder weaponry is becoming ever more prevalent, the Siege weapons of old may soon be entirely replaced by weapons such as the Cannon."

 gunpowderinventions.21.gun.a: "We shall use the §YTrebuchet§!, it’s cost effective firepower is still useful."
 gunpowderinventions.21.gun.b: "§YSiege Towers§! are currently required for our armies, we need to assault the enemy"

 gunpowderinventions.30.t: "Devaluation of Early Siege Weaponry"
 gunpowderinventions.30.d: "With the steady emergence of Gunpowder as the driving factor on the field of battle, weapons of old such as the Trebuchet and even early variants of the cannon have slowly become obsolete and more a burden as time has progressed. With the introduction of the Large Cast Bronze Mortar and the Houfnice, recent inventions such as the [western_cannon_invention_nation.GetAdjective] Cannon and the Gun of Urban are also growing increasingly inferior."

 teutonic_flavor_1356.1.t: "Fate of the Livonian Order"
 teutonic_flavor_1356.1.d: "Since the beginning of the Northern Crusades, the Teutonic Order has maintained a firm grip on the lands belonging to the former Slavic and Romuviai tribes of Prussia, Livonia and Estonia. While the main base of operations for the Order is centered in Marienburg, the northern section of Teutonic lands was granted to a new section of the order, the Livonian Order. If we seek to make further advancements into the last major Pagan holdouts in Lithuania, we should consider delegating further autonomy to our Livonian branch. Preventing this could greatly harm our relations with our Livionian branch while also putting our good relations with the Holy Roman Emperor at risk."
 teutonic_flavor_1356.1.a: "It is time the Livonian Order led the charge in the North"

 timurid_emergence.1.t: "Rise of Tamerlane"
 timurid_emergence.1.d: "While his status may belong to the lower ranking Barlas tribe, the young general named Timur ‘the Lame’ may be a worthy leader for our nation. While he is not a direct descendant of Genghis Khan, his skills in warfare is without question and his countless victories against dissent throughout Transoxiana is tremendous. Should we make him leader, our relations with Chagatai and the other Hordes will deteriorate and we will also become independent."
 timurid_emergence.1.a: "Timur's ability to lead is without question, he must become Ruler of Transoxiana"
 timurid_emergence.1.b: "Only a Borjigin can rule, but his accomplishments are notable, grant him a generalship."
 timurid_emergence.1.c: "§MExecute him, he’s too dangerous to keep alive§!"
 
 timurid_emergence.5.t: "Death of Tamerlane"
 timurid_emergence.5.d: "The mighty Warlord of Transoxiana Timur is dead. For a man whose life was filled with several battles and many great conquests, the conqueror passed away peacefully during the midst of night. Only time will tell how his successors will handle his empire, whether it succumbs to infighting and corruption like the Ilkhanate or the ambition of distant cousins vying for power like Genghis' empire of old. It is without doubt however that his death will have a major impact on those who surrounded the former Amir’s empire."

 timurid_emergence.2.t: "Timur demands our Subjugation"

 timurid_emergence.3.a: "With Khiva under our control we can focus our attention to Persia"
 
 timurid_emergence.4.t: "Khiva rejects Subjugation"
 timurid_emergence.4.d: "The ruler of Khiva has declined our demand for subjugation. Perhaps we should demonstrate to them what happens when you defy a generous offer."
