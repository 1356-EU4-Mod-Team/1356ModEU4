 new_institution_events.67.t: "Gunpowder Weaponry!"
 new_institution_events.67.d: "While Gunpowder has existed for centuries before this it was not common in weapons until recently. During the 1300's-1400's various nations in Asia experimented with what we have come to understand as Gunpowder weaponry. These weapons while still primitive in nature are very dangerous and posess the ability to kill hundreds of men at once. It is in our best interest to steal some of these early weapons for our own use so we do not fall too far behind our rivals."

Perhaps this is the edge our nation has always needed in warfare?"
