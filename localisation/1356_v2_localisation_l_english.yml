 flamamluk.1.t: "Coptic Advisors"
 flamamluk.1.d: "During the rule of the Mamluks many Sultans respected the Coptic minority, and quite frequently the Sultans gave respected Copts places in their court. Our advisors and close kin have found another Copt who would be of use to us. As usual they are a treasurer, but will happily work at a discount! We could always use more advisors, but turning them away could also who we have high expectations."
 flamamluk.1.a: "Welcome him in! Coptics are always welcome in my court!"

 flamamluk.3.t: "The Coptic Minority"
 flamamluk.3.d: "Historically the Coptic Egyptians in Egypt served as high ranking advisors to various Mamluk Sultans over the years, and many previous Mamluk Sultans have respected them, and even granted them protection as a religious minority! However recent tensions in our land are rising between the Coptics and the Arabs, and we must make a decision on the Coptic minority in our provinces!"
 flamamluk.3.a: "The Copts have been useful so far!"
 flamamluk.3.b: "Protected Minorities no more!"
 flamamluk.4.t: "Alexandria Converts to Coptic"
 flamamluk.4.d: "It appears that with rising tensions between the Coptic Egyptians and the Sunni Arabs our Vassal Alexandria has made a decision on what to do. They are embracing their heritage and are claiming to be in full support of their coptic bretheren now! They have declared independence from us as a result!"
 flamamluk.4.a: "How dare they!"
 
 alexandriaflandy.1.t: "The Coptics"
 alexandriaflandy.1.d: "The Coptics in Egypt have typically been tolerated by most Mamluk Sultans, many of them even held high ranking advisor positions! However it appears that the Sultan has made a final decree on the Coptics in Egypt, and the Mamluk Sultan no longer is giving protection to Christian Minorities! As a Vassal of the Sultan we ourselves must make our own decision. Shall we tolerate our Coptic Brothers and Sisters, or are they now second class citizens in their homeland?"

 alexandriaflandy.2.d: "The Coptics in Egypt have typically been tolerated by most Mamluk Sultans, many of them even held high ranking advisor positions! However it appears that the Sultan has made a final decree on the Coptics in Egypt, and the Mamluk Sultan has expanded the protection to Christian Minorities! As a Vassal of the Sultan we ourselves must make our own decision. Shall we tolerate our Coptic Brothers and Sisters, or are they now second class citizens in their homeland?"
 alexandriaflandy.2.a: "We must tolerate our population"
 alexandriaflandy.2.b: "Muslims are superior to Coptics!"
 alexandriaflandy.3.t: "Embrace our Coptic Egyptian Roots?"
 alexandriaflandy.3.d: "Since Egypt was conquered during the Arabic Invasion the Coptics have lived as minorities in their own homeland. Many Egyptians converted quickly to avoid persecution, while others waited and kept on with their daily life. Under the Mamluk Sultans the Copts were frequently given high ranking advisor positions, and were respected along with the Jewish minorities. However with recent tensions in Alexandria rising higher and higher every passing day perhaps we should make a decision that could change the fate of Egypt forever! However it will not be easy if we choose to challenge the Arabs..."
 alexandriaflandy.3.a: "Let us embrace our Coptic Roots!"
 alexandriaflandy.3.b: "The Copts belong as Advisors to the Sultan only!"

 alexandriaflandy.4.t: "The Massacure of Alexandria"
 alexandriaflandy.4.d: "Through the entire existance of a Muslim Egyptian state the Arabs and the Coptic Egyptians have fought back and forth in Egypt. Sometimes the Arabs would kill a few Copts, sometimes the Copts would kill a few Arabs. However after 1320 the problem began to get worse. \n\nNow the century of hatred has built up to a boiling point. There are now large fights in the streets of Alexandria! Thousands have been killed on both sides, and leaving most of the Egyptian Copts either killed or running south of Egypt in fear. If we wish to help them, we must act fast."
 alexandriaflandy.4.a: "Let it play out as it currently is..."
 alexandriaflandy.4.b: "We must intervene!"
 alexandriaflandy.5.t: "The Massacure of Alexandria"
 alexandriaflandy.5.d: "Through the course of the 1300's the Coptic Egyptians and the Arabs that controlled Egypt have been in constant conflict, with the Mamluk Sultan typically siding with tolerance. However with recent events this will never occur again, as a great fight broke out in the town of Alexandria. Thousands of Copts and Arabs alike were killed, with it all ending in a great fire. \n\nMany remaining Copts have fled south of Egypt, into the neighboring coptic nations south of Egypt. Only time will tell if the Copts will be able to recover from this tragedy."
 alexandriaflandy.5.a: "What a tragedy!"
 alexandriaflandy.6.t: "The Egyptian Copts"
 alexandriaflandy.6.d: "Very recently our Coptic brothers in Alexandria were sent from their homes running in fear for their life, the entire city of Alexandria cought fire and a sizeable portion of the remaining Egyptian Copts were killed during the fight before hand. Now there is a large group of Copts moving towards our country asking for asylum!"
 alexandriaflandy.6.a: "We welcome our Coptic bretheren with open arms!"

 chineseflv.4.t: "The Red Turban Rebellion"
 chineseflv.4.d: "This serves as a maintenance event to set the Red Turban Rebellion as allies and force them to work together against Yuan. This will last until Yuan holds under 85 provinces."

Any knowledge in the [TAG] was copied and stored in the Great Library for safe keepings, and to prevent another tragic loss it is on 24/7 guard. Perhaps this may usher in a new era for the world?"

Many Nestorian Diocese were quiet for centuries to come. \n\nTimur has now worked his way to Baghdad and its outlying provinces, and has rounded up all the Christians in the region, the soldiers are at the ready and are waiting for the word from the new Khan."

 flasavoy.NAME1: "The Cultural Isolation of Savoy"
 flasavoy.DESC1: "As the Duchy of Savoy has grown, it's become more and more culturally isolated. When it began as the County of Savoy it was part of the former Kingdom of Burgundy, but still Arpitan at that point. As it grew into Italy through inheritance & Conquest it was elevated to Duchy status in the early 1300's, and since then the Duchy of Savoy has had more interest in its Italian land than its home in Savoy. Perhaps it is time to accept the changes that have occured?"

 scan_djm.6.t: "The Greenland Carrier Returns"
 scan_djm.6.d: "The Greenland Carrier has returned! With it comes news that the Settlers of Greenland are very different from our own people. The Norse Mythologies of old still are practiced there, however some settlements are entirely Norse, and some entirely Christian. Many of them wish to trade with us for goods they require but struggle to get in Greenland. If we choose to setup a regular Trade route it'd benefit both us and Greenland. On top of this we can send the same ship and crew on a regular trip to and from Greenland to save money. Our Court highly recommends we choose to trade with them, however funds are always limited."

Recently, King Magnus IV of Sweden has the brilliant idea of having a religious debate with the Novgorodians, and according to the first and fourth Novgorodian chronicles it can be done. With the loser of the Religious Debate converting to the religion of the winner. These high stakes may prevent the [NOV.Monarch.GetTitle] of Novgorod from even responding to us, and with such it may just be easier to just declare war on them..."

They request that we debate their Religious leaders under our first and fourth founding chronicles. \n\nMany nobles in our nation are telling our court to ignore this strange request, some are telling us to have them debate the ones who converted us, and others are ready for the debate already. It appears our court is divided on this subject, and is the talk of the land. What are we to do?"

 scan_djm.11.d: "After a long period of waiting the Novgorodian court has finally responded to our request for a religious debate. They state that they have no interest in debating us, however since the Byzantines were the ones who converted the Rus people in the first place, we should debate them instead. Some advisors view this as an insult to us, others think of the possibilities. More irrational advisors think we could gain much favor with the Pope if we were to win a debate with Byzantium, but many brush them off as insane, as the Byzantine Clergy would never respond in the first place."

 scan_djm.12.b: "WAR IT IS!"
 scan_djm.13.t: "The Religious Debate - Sweden Challenges Byzantium"
 scan_djm.13.d: "For the past few months Sweden and Novgorod in the north have been bickering about religion, and it appears that Novgorod told Sweden they would not debate them about Christanity and Orthodoxy, and instead told them they should ask us, since we were the ones who converted the Russian people in the first place. Everyone in Byzantium agrees that this is a foolish request, but the important question is how do we respond to this message?"
 scan_djm.13.a: "Laugh at them, but don't respond."
 scan_djm.13.b: "Don't respond to Sweden."
 scan_djm.14.t: "The Religious Debate - Sweden is insulted!"
 scan_djm.14.d: "Byzantium never responded to our message requesting a religious debate! This act is viewed by all as an insult to the Swedish Nobility and Clergy. Some of our advisors see this as a chance to declare war to gain some favor with the Pope, others think we should prepare for this instead of acting rashly. Either way, our window for acting is shrinking and we must act fast!"
 scan_djm.14.a: "WAR IS DECLARED FOR THIS!"
