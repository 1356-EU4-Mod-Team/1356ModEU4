 desc_early_game_policy_dip: "While our diplomats get enough training it could never hurt to implement mandatory training in languages, culture, and traditions. This would enable our diplomats to sway the opinions of other countries much easier, as knowing local traditions and cultures would allow us to treat the rulers and diplomats of other countries with more respect, perhaps swaying their opinions just enough to aid us. However all this extra training will force our diplomats to take more time to go from court to court, as they need to educate themselves before they go somewhere. "

 desc_early_game_policy_adm: "If we want to keep the masses content we can grant them significant privileges now, and then change the policy up later than normal.

 desc_clergy_spies_policy: "Our religion is connected through many ways. Everyone goes to church, and everyone puts their faith in the church.

 flamamluk.1.t: "Coptic Advisors"
 flamamluk.1.d: "During the rule of the Mamluks many Sultans respected the Coptic minority, and quite frequently the Sultans gave respected Copts places in their court. Our advisors and close kin have found another Copt who would be of use to us. As usual they are a treasurer, but will happily work at a discount! We could always use more advisors, but turning them away could also who we have high expectations."

 flamamluk.2.b: "We do not need their help currently, send them away."
 flamamluk.3.t: "The Coptic Minority"
 flamamluk.3.d: "Historically the Coptic Egyptians in Egypt served as high ranking advisors to various Mamluk Sultans over the years, and many previous Mamluk Sultans have respected them, and even granted them protection as a religious minority! However recent tensions in our land are rising between the Coptics and the Arabs, and we must make a decision on the Coptic minority in our provinces!"

 flamamluk.3.b: "Protected Minorities no more!"
 flamamluk.4.t: "Alexandria Converts to Coptic"
 flamamluk.4.d: "It appears that with rising tensions between the Coptic Egyptians and the Sunni Arabs our Vassal Alexandria has made a decision on what to do. They are embracing their heritage and are claiming to be in full support of their coptic bretheren now! They have declared independence from us as a result!"
 flamamluk.4.a: "How dare they!"
 
 alexandriaflandy.1.t: "The Coptics"
 alexandriaflandy.1.d: "The Coptics in Egypt have typically been tolerated by most Mamluk Sultans, many of them even held high ranking advisor positions! However it appears that the Sultan has made a final decree on the Coptics in Egypt, and the Mamluk Sultan no longer is giving protection to Christian Minorities! As a Vassal of the Sultan we ourselves must make our own decision. Shall we tolerate our Coptic Brothers and Sisters, or are they now second class citizens in their homeland?"

 alexandriaflandy.1.b: "Muslims are superior to Coptics!"
 alexandriaflandy.2.t: "The Coptics"
 alexandriaflandy.2.d: "The Coptics in Egypt have typically been tolerated by most Mamluk Sultans, many of them even held high ranking advisor positions! However it appears that the Sultan has made a final decree on the Coptics in Egypt, and the Mamluk Sultan has expanded the protection to Christian Minorities!

 alexandriaflandy.2.b: "Muslims are superior to Coptics!"
 alexandriaflandy.3.t: "Embrace our Coptic Egyptian Roots?"
 alexandriaflandy.3.d: "Since Egypt was conquered during the Arabic Invasion the Coptics have lived as minorities in their own homeland. Many Egyptians converted quickly to avoid persecution, while others waited and kept on with their daily life. Under the Mamluk Sultans the Copts were frequently given high ranking advisor positions, and were respected along with the Jewish minorities. However with recent tensions in Alexandria rising higher and higher every passing day perhaps we should make a decision that could change the fate of Egypt forever! However it will not be easy if we choose to challenge the Arabs..."
 alexandriaflandy.3.a: "Let us embrace our Coptic Roots!"

 alexandriaflandy.4.t: "The Massacure of Alexandria"
 alexandriaflandy.4.d: "Through the entire existance of a Muslim Egyptian state the Arabs and the Coptic Egyptians have fought back and forth in Egypt. Sometimes the Arabs would kill a few Copts, sometimes the Copts would kill a few Arabs. However after 1320 the problem began to get worse. \n\nNow the century of hatred has built up to a boiling point. There are now large fights in the streets of Alexandria! Thousands have been killed on both sides, and leaving most of the Egyptian Copts either killed or running south of Egypt in fear. If we wish to help them, we must act fast."
 alexandriaflandy.4.a: "Let it play out as it currently is..."
 alexandriaflandy.4.b: "We must intervene!"
 alexandriaflandy.5.t: "The Massacure of Alexandria"
 alexandriaflandy.5.d: "Through the course of the 1300's the Coptic Egyptians and the Arabs that controlled Egypt have been in constant conflict, with the Mamluk Sultan typically siding with tolerance. However with recent events this will never occur again, as a great fight broke out in the town of Alexandria. Thousands of Copts and Arabs alike were killed, with it all ending in a great fire. \n\nMany remaining Copts have fled south of Egypt, into the neighboring coptic nations south of Egypt. Only time will tell if the Copts will be able to recover from this tragedy."
 alexandriaflandy.5.a: "What a tragedy!"
 alexandriaflandy.6.t: "The Egyptian Copts"
 alexandriaflandy.6.d: "Very recently our Coptic brothers in Alexandria were sent from their homes running in fear for their life, the entire city of Alexandria cought fire and a sizeable portion of the remaining Egyptian Copts were killed during the fight before hand. Now there is a large group of Copts moving towards our country asking for asylum!"

 flagreatproject.1.d: "The Great Library of Alexandria was burned down in the Roman Civil War circa 48BC, it was partially rebuilt for it to last until somewhere circa 270AD where it was completly destroyed, or whatever may have been left of it. \n\nNow the Clergy, Nobility, and peasants have all worked together under the reign of [ALX.Monarch.GetTitle] [ALX.Monarch.GetName] in [TAG] seems to have finally finished their ambitious reconstruction of the Great Library of Alexandria. Any knowledge in the [TAG] was copied and stored in the Great Library for safe keepings, and to prevent another tragic loss it is on 24/7 guard. Perhaps this may usher in a new era for the world?"

 timurlane.992.d: "Historically when Timur conquered a region he massacred many Christians in the regions he conquered. Baghdad and the Nestorian Assyrians were no exception, when he made his way to their homes in Mesopotamia he massacred many Assyrians that resided there, he brought them to their knees and drastically reduced the population of Assyrians in the world, and at the end of the reign of Timur the Assyrian population had almost been eradicated in many places. Many Nestorian Diocese were quiet for centuries to come. \n\nTimur has now worked his way to Baghdad and its outlying provinces, and has rounded up all the Christians in the region, the soldiers are at the ready and are waiting for the word from the new Khan."

 flasavoy.NAME1: "The Cultural Isolation of Savoy"
 flasavoy.DESC1: "As the Duchy of Savoy has grown, it's become more and more culturally isolated. When it began as the County of Savoy it was part of the former Kingdom of Burgundy, but still Arpitan at that point. As it grew into Italy through inheritance & Conquest it was elevated to Duchy status in the early 1300's, and since then the Duchy of Savoy has had more interest in its Italian land than its home in Savoy. Perhaps it is time to accept the changes that have occured?"

Many of them wish to trade with us for goods they require but struggle to get in Greenland. If we choose to setup a regular Trade route it'd benefit both us and Greenland. On top of this we can send the same ship and crew on a regular trip to and from Greenland to save money. Our Court highly recommends we choose to trade with them, however funds are always limited."

 new_institution_events.20.t: "Profitable Trading"
 new_institution_events.20.d: "Our trade has been bringing in much more money than usual lately, so much so that it outnumbers our taxes by a large margin. This has got a lot of traders that reside in our nation talking about how they can best make use of this, while many high ranking advisors debate if we should tax traders more than we do already. Before we think much more about making more money off of traders perhaps we should give their conversations a good listen, we could learn something new from them after all."
 new_institution_events.20.a: "Perhaps these commoners could teach us something new after all..."
 new_institution_events.20.b: "We can learn nothing from a commoner! Implement a tariff on all imports!"
 new_institution_events.21.t: "Profitable Trading?"
 new_institution_events.21.d: "Due to our control over an important §Center of Trade§ our advisors tend to spend a lot of time at port in their free time. Recently there's been a some of talk about 'Merchantilism' and how if our trade is profitable it'll help stimulate more wealth than what it already brings in. No one has yet to come forth with ideas, however [ROOT.Monarch.GetTitle] [ROOT.Monarch.GetName] has a few ideas that come to [ROOT.GetHerHis] mind. Perhaps if we ask our advisors we may be able to come up with a new policy or two."
 new_institution_events.21.a: "More long term profit sounds nice!"

Recently there's been a lot of talk about 'Merchantilism' and how if our trade is profitable it'll help stimulate more wealth than what it already brings in. Various members of the administration have already come to us talking about ideas and new trade policies, while even a few close family members have come forth with ideas. If we listen closely to these ideas we may be able to come up with a way to profit even more from our existing trade..."

 new_institution_events.22.b: "I'd rather have more money in the treasury now!"
 new_institution_events.23.t: "The rise of mercantilism & the use of paper"
 new_institution_events.23.d: "With the rise of Mercantilism the interest in paper has risen, and so we're now able to use this to our advantage. Since we've yet to fully understand what all this talk of 'Mercantilism' is we may be able to trade off some of our paper for some assistance in understanding this better."
 new_institution_events.23.a: "It is a good trade!"
 new_institution_events.23.b: "Just sell the paper like usual, we'll understand it later."

 new_institution_events.30.t: "The Growth of Mercantilism" 
 new_institution_events.30.d: "As of recent some of our province level governors have started using their connections with merchants to gain more insight into how to generate more wealth through trade. Most of these plans have never worked in the past, however as of recent a wave of interest in this idea has started to sweep through Europe, making this concept easier to achieve. While we're not the first [Root.GovernmentName] to achieve this with success we're still quick enough to gain something out of it."
 new_institution_events.30.a: "Hmm..."
 
 new_institution_events.35.t: "Excess Paper Production"
 new_institution_events.35.d: "Thanks to our excess production of paper in [Root.GetName] we've been able to centralize our [Root.GovernmentName] by the introduction of more paper. Previously the use of Parchment & expensive paper goods was common in our [Root.GovernmentName] up until recently."
 new_institution_events.35.a: "Excess paper? What shall we do with it all!"
 new_institution_events.36.t: "Mercantilism & Centers of Trade"
 new_institution_events.36.d: "Due to the importance of the Center of Trade in [Root.GetName] local Counts and Barons have begun to encourage trade with Merchant Families more often. In return for buying more of their goods the Lords are offering discounts claiming that the sale of these goods is helping the local economy. Regardless of your thoughts on the matter it seems to be effective, increasing revenue across the board. Perhaps we could embrace this on a larger scale?"

 new_institution_events.38.a: "Encouage these dealings" 
 
 new_institution_events.40.t: "The Relationship between Merchant Republics and Cities"
 new_institution_events.40.d: "Due to our frequent trading with the Kingdoms around us we have made quite a profit from trading the goods peasant folk make. However profits are frequently low due to all the extra expenses we have, and this does not please most of the merchant families. Due to this recently we've been working with local governments of areas we trade with to find a way to maximize profit for both parties. As long as we keep trading with the cities and purchasing goods created within their city limits we'll get a slight discount! The local governments believe they benefit from this due to trade potentially generating wealth that didn't exist before. Regardless of if it's fully believed by the merchant families it clearly brings us more revenue, so we have no reason to argue. Perhaps we can investigate further into what makes this policy work and make similar agreements with other cities we frequently trade with..."
 new_institution_events.40.a: "Either way, this sounds profitable!"
 new_institution_events.40.b: "Perhaps we can use this to get something more..."
 
 new_institution_events.50.t: "The Growth of Mercantilism in the West"
 new_institution_events.50.d: "Thanks to our attempts to prevent the fracturing of our nation we've managed to centralize our administration in the process. This has allowed us to embrace some ideas that have recently become popular in the rest of the world. While 'Mercantilism' has become popular in the west many countries in our area have begun to centralize their Administrations with this knowledge that has spread. If we follow their example perhaps we can cut down on the number of future revolts from inside our administration. However knowing this we could keep it to ourselves and watch how this progresses, as we could learn something perhaps."
 new_institution_events.50.a: "No, we need a centralized administation"
 new_institution_events.50.b: "Let us keep this information to ourselves for now"
 new_institution_events.51.t: "The Growth of Mercantilism"
 new_institution_events.51.d: "The rise of Mercantilist policies in the various Hanseatic Merchant Republics have laid the road to new ideals in Monarchies as well as Republics. Local Counts have begun making deals with various merchant families to generate more revenue between them. While these policies seem to work well on a local level there are possibilities we can expand on this at a Kingdom level, however we could also let things continue as they are now and raise the taxes on a local level instead."
 new_institution_events.51.a: "Let us adopt this at the [ROOT.Government.Name] level"
 new_institution_events.51.b: "Raise the taxes!"
 
 new_institution_events.60.t: "The Handcannon"
 new_institution_events.60.d: "Even though Gunpowder weapons have been around for around a century only recently have people begun to take interest in these strange weapons from the far east. However our researchers now have innovated on existing designs and may have created the first hand held cannon. The 'Handcannon' is the first of its kind, and perhaps is a sign of things to come... Perhaps this is the edge our nation has always needed in warfare?"
 new_institution_events.60.a: "Interesting..."
 
 
 flaprices.1.t: "The beginning of early modern printing"
 flaprices.1.d: "While the production of paper has been in existance for centuries, it's only recently begun to become more and more commonplace. With it starting in China circa 250-650AD, and moving to the Islamic World circa 750AD it didnt even take off in Europe until the first Paper Mill in Xàtiva, Aragon in the 11th century. Even then only a handful of locations in Europe began to produce paper through the next few centuries. The demand for paper is growing and prices are still high, so any innovations in the paper making industry are highly sought after. While its not quite full-on 16th century paper production, its early growth is slowly beginning."
 flaprices.1.a: "Fascinating..."
 flaprices.3.t: "The Paper Industry in Holland"
 flaprices.3.d: "While the paper industry had already spread through the Low Countries by now there was still much room for expansion of the new Paper Mills, and thanks to a few rich merchants we've received word that paper has become our primary export in [ROOT.GetName] now!"
 flaprices.3.a: "Fetch me some of this new paper!"
 flaprices.4.t: "The Paper Industry in Savoy"
 flaprices.4.d: "While the spread of Paper Production was spreading to France and Italy through Iberia, Savoy itself didn't start producing paper until later than other Italian states, leaving them with a large experience gap between them and the other Italian paper producers. Nonetheless paper is becoming more sought after so even if we can't quite manage to produce the same quality paper as everyone else we can still make quite a profit."
 flaprices.4.a: "Bring me some of this new paper!"
 flaprices.5.t: "The Paper Industry in Franconia"
 flaprices.5.d: "Historically Paper Production was already in full swing in France, Iberia, and Italy. The German paper production only has begun to kick off sometime after the 1300's. They began to pop up in places like Mainz, Nuremberg, and Holland to start, eventually spreading into other Free Cities as well. While the Franconia may not be a suitable area for Paper production and may not be as successful as the ones in Italy or Iberia, it will turn a profit nonetheless."
 flaprices.5.a: "I must try some of this new paper!"
 flaprices.6.t: "The Paper Industry in the Upper Rhineland"
 flaprices.6.d: "Historically Paper Production was already in full swing in France, Iberia, and Italy. The German paper production only has begun to kick off sometime after the 1300's. They began to pop up in places like Mainz, Nuremberg, and Holland to start, eventually spreading into other Free Cities as well. While the Rhineland may not be a suitable area for Paper production and may not be as successful as the ones in Italy or Iberia, it will turn a profit nonetheless."
 flaprices.6.a: "New paper? Bring some in for the court to try!"
 flaprices.7.t: "The Paper Industry in the West Midlands"
 flaprices.7.d: "The first Paper Mill in England was setup near Hertford, however it was not as successful as anyone would have wished. It wasn't for another century that England would get a successful Paper Mill. This paper in [ROOT.GetName] wasn't even built in a region suitable for paper production, so let us hope that the Paper Mill can keep its head above water, else we lose our only paper production in all of England."
 flaprices.7.a: "What an odd location for paper production"
 flaprices.8.t: "The Collapse of the West Midlands Paper Mill"
 flaprices.8.d: "Our paper production in the West Midlands has struggled to turn a profit ever since starting up a few decades back. It's been propped up by merchants, the local nobility, and occasional donations from the crown. However after failing to turn a profit for so long the Paper Mill in the West Midlands has shut down. Perhaps in the future we'll be able to produce a sustainable paper mill elsewhere in [Root.GetName]"
 flaprices.8.a: "Alas, now we must import our paper again!"
 flaprices.9.t: "The Paper Industry in East Anglia"
 flaprices.9.d: "A new Paper Mill has been setup East Anglia and is already turning a large profit! It appears that has become the primary trade good in [ROOT.GetName] already. Perhaps this may already be a sign of things to come?"
 flaprices.9.a: "Perhaps this paper mill may fare better than the last."

 flaeng.40.t: "The Rise of English Longbowmen"
 flaeng.40.d: "Longbows have been used for centuries in warfare by now, however they began to become more favored in the Hundred Years War. The Longbow was effective against the French in many battles during the Hundred Years War, with the most famous being the battle of Agincourt. Due to the range they can reach longbows were effective in early skirmishes, on top of this they were able to penetrate Plate and Mail Armor up until the later Medieval Period. English longbows eventully fell out of favor due to the rise of Gunpowder weapons, but were occasionally used when they were needed past then."
 flaeng.40.a: "Perhaps we finally have an advantage over the French"
 flaeng.41.t: "The Decline of English Longbowmen"
 flaeng.41.d: "The mighty English Longbowmen were a force to be feared at their prime. Being able to cut down a knight with a single arrow was an effective way to turn a battle in your favor before it even began. However as the decades went on Armor got better and arrows lost their ability to penetrate armor. Eventually longbow regiments were traded out for regiments of rifles instead, however they did show up in battles for a few decades even after they fell out of favor."

 flagreatproject.6.t: "The Destruction of the Theodosian Walls"
 flagreatproject.6.d: "The Theodosian walls were built many centuries ago first during the reign of Theodosius II during the years of 408-450, and were nearly impossible to breach for about 800 years. A few times during those 800 years the city almost fell, but it never fully fell to an outside force until 1204 by the Crusaders on the Fourth Crusade. They were rebuilt after the defenses were breached, however historically they would not hold a second attack when they suffered severe damage in 1453 from an Ottoman siege. Now the walls have finally fallen to a siege from the outside, and in the year [GetYear] the walls of Constantinople have finally fallen, perhaps for the last time. The Eastern Roman Empire is on the verge of extinction, after so many years."
 flagreatproject.6.a: "We're vulnerable! Quick, send men into the breach!"
 flagreatproject.7.t: "The Popularity of Cannons over Traditional Siege Equipment"
 flagreatproject.7.d: "With the rise in popularity of cannons instead of older fashioned siege equipment such as the Trebuchet a weakness in traditional castles has been found. Most 'modern' cannons can quickly and easily blast a hole in traditional castles, causing a need for new defenses to be created, and soon. This however will cause a handful of major defenses across the globe to become worthless, making those nations vulnerable for the first time in centuries."
 flagreatproject.7.a: "A new era is upon us!"
 flagreatproject.8.t: "The Completion of the new Theodosian Walls"
 flagreatproject.8.d: "After the destruction of the Theodosian walls previously, we've managed to gather enough resources to rebuilt them again! They may not be as powerful as they once were but at least having the walls should discourage all but the most ambitious attack."

 1356policyevents.51.d: "While our Diplomats typically are trained and sent to far away courts to appease various Kings and Queens this isn't always the case. A few of our diplomats in their free time have been going from court to court locally trying to appease the local Dukes, Counts, and Barons under our rule. It seems to have paid off as we now have the opportunity to offer them a 'deal' in order to gain more of their loyalty..."

 1356policyevents.101.d: "While the policy of Mandatory service of every male between the ages of 16-35 may be an easy way to keep our armies fully stocked by no means is it a good policy to keep around in times of peace. Peasants do not like their family being taken away from them without reason, and right now there is no justified reason to take their family away from them. Perhaps we can send some of their family home and pocket some extra taxes this year before we get a revolt?"
 1356policyevents.101.a: "Send some of the peasants home!"

As a result of this the Berbers under us have begun to show signs of what could be considered distinctly different from the rest of the Berbers in Maghreb. Perhaps this is the beginning of a new cultural identity after all."

 gun_events.1.d: "More white men have shown up on our shores, but their purpose doesn't seem to be trade. They claim to be spreading the word of someone named "Deus". Even some of our men believe in this "Deus". We already have a faith, but they seem unfaltering about wanting us to convert to their God."

 gun_events.3.d: ""It is the duty of every pious man," continued the Castilian priest, "to enforce God's will against the infidel." The Castilians had come not for trade nor to evangelize, but to make a proposal. They claim that our participation in a crusade against the Moors would prove we are of the Catholic faith. They promise us the port of Ifni if we participate, as well as our eternal salvation."

 gun_events.4.t: "The Guanches Refuse to Fight"
 gun_events.4.d: "The Guanches have refused their one opportunity to prove they are true Catholics by not participating in the Moorish Crusade.

 gun_events.5.a: "Wonderful!"
 gun_events.6.t: "A Western Education?"
 gun_events.6.d: "The King of Portugal has made an offer to allow our heir a western education in the Portuguese court, for a small price. This would be a once in a lifetime opportunity to transform this loose confederation of tribes into a kingdom like the ones in Europe! Though some would argue that the old ways are better, and that the ways of Europe would corrupt our traditions. The king is deep in thought."

 gun_events.6.b: "Why change the status quo when we are doing just fine?"
 gun_events.7.t: "Western Education Pays Off"
 gun_events.7.d: "Our heir has returned upon hearing of the death of the old chief, and his first action is to reform the Canary Islands into a monarchy. He has reformed almost every aspect of society, laying the groundwork for a new Guanche identity. We are no longer a loose confederation of tribes, but the Kingdom of the Canaries!"
 gun_events.7.a: "Time to build a new country."
 
 gun_events.9.t: "The conversion of the Guanche Peoples"
 gun_events.9.d: "We had previously allowed the King of Portugal to stay and spread the word of 'Deus', it appears they have managed to gain significant interest of our population! There may be a chance that these white men may convert the majority of our people to 'Deus'!"
 gun_events.9.a: "Only time will tell what occurs"
 gun_events.10.t: "The Conversion of the Guanches"
 gun_events.10.d: "It appears that the Portuguese sent missionaries to the Canary islands! Not only did they stay, but it appears they may have convinced a handful of locals to follow the teachings of Jesus! Thanks to this they have a more firm grasp on the islands than we do! We must take charge of the situation and handle this, less we allow the Portuguese to gain more control in the region!"
