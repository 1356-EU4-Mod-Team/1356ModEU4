What helped the Mongolian horse archers above other horse archers is the stirrup, allowing the Mongolian archers to be able to turn in all directions, including backwards. This allowed them to safely combat any foe on horse and foot alike.

 early_game_policy_dip: "Extra Diplomatic Training"
 desc_early_game_policy_dip: "While our diplomats get enough training it could never hurt to implement mandatory training in languages, culture, and traditions. This would enable our diplomats to sway the opinions of other countries much easier, as knowing local traditions and cultures would allow us to treat the rulers and diplomats of other countries with more respect, perhaps swaying their opinions just enough to aid us. However all this extra training will force our diplomats to take more time to go from court to court, as they need to educate themselves before they go somewhere. "

However recent tensions in our land are rising between the Coptics and the Arabs, and we must make a decision on the Coptic minority in our provinces!"

However it appears that the Sultan has made a final decree on the Coptics in Egypt, and the Mamluk Sultan no longer is giving protection to Christian Minorities! As a Vassal of the Sultan we ourselves must make our own decision. Shall we tolerate our Coptic Brothers and Sisters, or are they now second class citizens in their homeland?"

Many Egyptians converted quickly to avoid persecution, while others waited and kept on with their daily life. Under the Mamluk Sultans the Copts were frequently given high ranking advisor positions, and were respected along with the Jewish minorities. However with recent tensions in Alexandria rising higher and higher every passing day perhaps we should make a decision that could change the fate of Egypt forever! However it will not be easy if we choose to challenge the Arabs..."

 alexandriaflandy.4.d: "Through the entire existance of a Muslim Egyptian state the Arabs and the Coptic Egyptians have fought back and forth in Egypt. Sometimes the Arabs would kill a few Copts, sometimes the Copts would kill a few Arabs. However after 1320 the problem began to get worse. \n\nNow the century of hatred has built up to a boiling point. There are now large fights in the streets of Alexandria! Thousands have been killed on both sides, and leaving most of the Egyptian Copts either killed or running south of Egypt in fear. If we wish to help them, we must act fast."

 alexandriaflandy.5.d: "Through the course of the 1300's the Coptic Egyptians and the Arabs that controlled Egypt have been in constant conflict, with the Mamluk Sultan typically siding with tolerance. However with recent events this will never occur again, as a great fight broke out in the town of Alexandria. Thousands of Copts and Arabs alike were killed, with it all ending in a great fire. \n\nMany remaining Copts have fled south of Egypt, into the neighboring coptic nations south of Egypt. Only time will tell if the Copts will be able to recover from this tragedy."

Baghdad and the Nestorian Assyrians were no exception, when he made his way to their homes in Mesopotamia he massacred many Assyrians that resided there, he brought them to their knees and drastically reduced the population of Assyrians in the world, and at the end of the reign of Timur the Assyrian population had almost been eradicated in many places.

 new_institution_events.4.d: "Due to the rise of Gunpowder weapons the use of our Juhwa and Hwacha's have fallen out of favor, being replaced by captured Cannons. Many Admirals and Generals refuse to use our own locally produced gunpowder based weapons now. Perhaps it is time to retire them?"
 new_institution_events.4.a: "Gunpowder weapons will be the death of us..."
 new_institution_events.5.t: "The Rise of Gunpowder Weapons"
 new_institution_events.5.d: "With the use of cannon based gunpowder our handheld gunpowder weapons have begun to fall out of favor with our Generals. As effective as our 'Heaven-Shaking-Thunder bomb' has been, it may be time to retire it in favor of more conventional weapons..."
 new_institution_events.5.a: "Such a great weapon, reduced to a mere childs toy."
 new_institution_events.6.t: "The Rise of Gunpowder Weapons"
 new_institution_events.6.d: "The Gunpowder weapons and technology we stole from the Chinese has become increasingly more and more outdated, with many various Generals abandoning them all together.

 new_institution_events.20.t: "Profitable Trading"
 new_institution_events.20.d: "Our trade has been bringing in much more money than usual lately, so much so that it outnumbers our taxes by a large margin. This has got a lot of traders that reside in our nation talking about how they can best make use of this, while many high ranking advisors debate if we should tax traders more than we do already. Before we think much more about making more money off of traders perhaps we should give their conversations a good listen, we could learn something new from them after all."
 new_institution_events.20.a: "Perhaps these commoners could teach us something new after all..."
 new_institution_events.20.b: "We can learn nothing from a commoner! Implement a tariff on all imports!"
 new_institution_events.21.t: "Profitable Trading?"
 new_institution_events.21.d: "Due to our control over an important Trading center, our advisors tend to spend a lot of time at port in their free time. Recently there's been some of talk about 'Merchantilism' and how if our trade is profitable it'll help stimulate more wealth than what it already brings in. No one has yet to come forth with ideas, however [ROOT.Monarch.GetTitle] [ROOT.Monarch.GetName] has a few ideas that come to [ROOT.GetHerHis] mind. Perhaps if we ask our advisors we may be able to come up with a new policy or two."
 new_institution_events.21.a: "More long term profit sounds nice!"
 new_institution_events.21.b: "I'd rather have more money in the treasury now!"
 new_institution_events.22.t: "New Trade Policy?"
 new_institution_events.22.d: "Due to our control over an important Trading center, our merchants have been able to gather information about other popular trading centers. From this some of the wealthier merchants in our relam have been able to get a better understanding of foreign trade practices, benefiting them in their endeavors. Various members of the administration who have ties to these merchants have been discussing if it would be possible to implement some of these foreign trading policies into our own to give our nation an edge in trade."
 new_institution_events.22.a: "More long term profit sounds nice!"
 new_institution_events.22.b: "Levy a tax from the merchants instead"
 new_institution_events.23.t: "Mercantilism increases demand for Paper"
 new_institution_events.23.d: "With the practice of Mercantilism growing across the country, the demand for paper has only increased. With merchants needing paper for recording trade deals and state officials such as scribes requiring it to record important affairs throughout the country, this resource could bring our country some extra needed income."
 new_institution_events.23.a: "Assign administrators to develop one of our Paper industries"
 new_institution_events.23.b: "Seize Paper supplies and sell them to the Merchants"

 new_institution_events.30.t: "The Growth of Mercantilism" 
 new_institution_events.30.d: "As of recent some of our province level governors have started using their connections with merchants to gain more insight into how to generate more wealth through trade. Most of these plans have never worked in the past, however as of recent a wave of interest in this idea has started to sweep through Europe, making this concept easier to achieve. While we're not the first [Root.GovernmentName] to achieve this with success we're still quick enough to gain something out of it."
 new_institution_events.30.a: "Mercantilism will reshape the way we conduct Trade"
 
 new_institution_events.35.t: "Excess Paper Production"
 new_institution_events.35.d: "Thanks to our excess production of paper in [Root.GetName] we've been able to centralize our [Root.GovernmentName] by the introduction of more paper. Previously the use of Parchment & expensive paper goods was common in our [Root.GovernmentName] up until recently."
 new_institution_events.35.a: "Excess paper? What shall we do with it all!"
 new_institution_events.36.t: "Mercantilism & Centers of Trade"
 new_institution_events.36.d: "Due to the importance of the Center of Trade in [Root.GetName] local Counts and Barons have begun to encourage trade with Merchant Families more often. In return for buying more of their goods the Lords are offering discounts claiming that the sale of these goods is helping the local economy. Regardless of your thoughts on the matter it seems to be effective, increasing revenue across the board. Perhaps we could embrace this on a larger scale?"

 new_institution_events.38.a: "Encouage these dealings" 
 
 new_institution_events.40.t: "The Relationship between Merchant Republics and Cities"
 new_institution_events.40.d: "Due to our frequent trading with the Kingdoms around us we have made quite a profit from trading the goods peasant folk make. However profits are frequently low due to all the extra expenses we have, and this does not please most of the merchant families. Due to this recently we've been working with local governments of areas we trade with to find a way to maximize profit for both parties. As long as we keep trading with the cities and purchasing goods created within their city limits we'll get a slight discount! The local governments believe they benefit from this due to trade potentially generating wealth that didn't exist before. Regardless of if it's fully believed by the merchant families it clearly brings us more revenue, so we have no reason to argue. Perhaps we can investigate further into what makes this policy work and make similar agreements with other cities we frequently trade with..."
 new_institution_events.40.a: "Either way, this sounds profitable!"
 new_institution_events.40.b: "Perhaps we can use this to get something more..."
 
 new_institution_events.50.t: "The Growth of Mercantilism in the West"
 new_institution_events.50.d: "Thanks to our attempts to prevent the fracturing of our nation we've managed to centralize our administration in the process. This has allowed us to embrace some ideas that have recently become popular in the rest of the world. While 'Mercantilism' has become popular in the west many countries in our area have begun to centralize their Administrations with this knowledge that has spread. If we follow their example perhaps we can cut down on the number of future revolts from inside our administration. However knowing this we could keep it to ourselves and watch how this progresses, as we could learn something perhaps."
 new_institution_events.50.a: "No, we need a centralized administation"
 new_institution_events.50.b: "Let us keep this information to ourselves for now"
 new_institution_events.51.t: "The Growth of Mercantilism"
 new_institution_events.51.d: "The rise of Mercantilist policies in the various Hanseatic Merchant Republics have laid the road to new ideals in Monarchies as well as other Republics. Local Counts and Dukes have begun making deals with various merchant families to generate more revenue for themselves, further spreading Mercantilist ideals. While these policies seem to work well on a local level there are possibilities we can expand on this at a Kingdom level, however we could also let things continue as they are now and raise the taxes on a local level instead."
 new_institution_events.51.a: "Let us adopt these reforms at the national level."
 new_institution_events.51.b: "Raise the taxes!"
 
 new_institution_events.60.t: "The Handcannon"
 new_institution_events.60.d: "Even though Gunpowder weapons have been around for around a century only recently have people begun to take interest in these strange weapons from the far east. However our researchers now have innovated on existing designs and may have created the first hand held cannon. The 'Handcannon' is the first of its kind, and perhaps is a sign of things to come... Perhaps this is the edge our nation has always needed in warfare?"
 new_institution_events.60.a: "Interesting..."
 
 
 flaprices.1.t: "The beginning of early modern printing"
 flaprices.1.d: "While the production of paper has been in existance for centuries, it's only recently begun to become more and more commonplace. With it starting in China circa 250-650AD, and moving to the Islamic World circa 750AD it didnt even take off in Europe until the first Paper Mill in Xàtiva, Aragon in the 11th century. Even then only a handful of locations in Europe began to produce paper through the next few centuries. The demand for paper is growing and prices are still high, so any innovations in the paper making industry are highly sought after. While its not quite full-on 16th century paper production, its early growth is slowly beginning."
 flaprices.1.a: "Fascinating..."
 flaprices.3.t: "The Paper Industry in Holland"
 flaprices.3.d: "While the paper industry had already spread through the Low Countries by now there was still much room for expansion of the new Paper Mills, and thanks to a few rich merchants we've received word that paper has become our primary export in [ROOT.GetName] now!"
 flaprices.3.a: "Fetch me some of this new paper!"
 flaprices.4.t: "The Paper Industry in Savoy"
 flaprices.4.d: "While the spread of Paper Production was spreading to France and Italy through Iberia, Savoy itself didn't start producing paper until later than other Italian states, leaving them with a large experience gap between them and the other Italian paper producers. Nonetheless paper is becoming more sought after so even if we can't quite manage to produce the same quality paper as everyone else we can still make quite a profit."
 flaprices.4.a: "Bring me some of this new paper!"
 flaprices.5.t: "The Paper Industry in Franconia"
 flaprices.5.d: "Historically Paper Production was already in full swing in France, Iberia, and Italy. The German paper production only has begun to kick off sometime after the 1300's. They began to pop up in places like Mainz, Nuremberg, and Holland to start, eventually spreading into other Free Cities as well. While the Franconia may not be a suitable area for Paper production and may not be as successful as the ones in Italy or Iberia, it will turn a profit nonetheless."
 flaprices.5.a: "I must try some of this new paper!"
 flaprices.6.t: "The Paper Industry in the Upper Rhineland"
 flaprices.6.d: "Historically Paper Production was already in full swing in France, Iberia, and Italy. The German paper production only has begun to kick off sometime after the 1300's. They began to pop up in places like Mainz, Nuremberg, and Holland to start, eventually spreading into other Free Cities as well. While the Rhineland may not be a suitable area for Paper production and may not be as successful as the ones in Italy or Iberia, it will turn a profit nonetheless."
 flaprices.6.a: "New paper? Bring some in for the court to try!"
 flaprices.7.t: "The Paper Industry in the West Midlands"
 flaprices.7.d: "The first Paper Mill in England was setup near Hertford, however it was not as successful as anyone would have wished. It wasn't for another century that England would get a successful Paper Mill. This paper in [ROOT.GetName] wasn't even built in a region suitable for paper production, so let us hope that the Paper Mill can keep its head above water, else we lose our only paper production in all of England."
 flaprices.7.a: "What an odd location for paper production"
 flaprices.8.t: "The Collapse of the West Midlands Paper Mill"
 flaprices.8.d: "Our paper production in the West Midlands has struggled to turn a profit ever since starting up a few decades back. It's been propped up by merchants, the local nobility, and occasional donations from the crown. However after failing to turn a profit for so long the Paper Mill in the West Midlands has shut down. Perhaps in the future we'll be able to produce a sustainable paper mill elsewhere in [Root.GetName]"
 flaprices.8.a: "Alas, now we must import our paper again!"
 flaprices.9.t: "The Paper Industry in East Anglia"
 flaprices.9.d: "A new Paper Mill has been setup East Anglia and is already turning a large profit! It appears that has become the primary trade good in [ROOT.GetName] already. Perhaps this may already be a sign of things to come?"
 flaprices.9.a: "Perhaps this paper mill may fare better than the last."

 flaeng.40.t: "The Rise of English Longbowmen"
 flaeng.40.d: "Longbows have been used for centuries in warfare by now, however they began to become more favored in the Hundred Years War. The Longbow was effective against the French in many battles during the Hundred Years War, with the most famous being the battle of Agincourt. Due to the range they can reach longbows were effective in early skirmishes, on top of this they were able to penetrate Plate and Mail Armor up until the later Medieval Period. English longbows eventully fell out of favor due to the rise of Gunpowder weapons, but were occasionally used when they were needed past then."
 flaeng.40.a: "Perhaps we finally have an advantage over the French"
 flaeng.41.t: "The Decline of English Longbowmen"
 flaeng.41.d: "The mighty English Longbowmen were a force to be feared at their prime. Being able to cut down a knight with a single arrow was an effective way to turn a battle in your favor before it even began. However as the decades went on Armor got better and arrows lost their ability to penetrate armor. Eventually longbow regiments were traded out for regiments of rifles instead, however they did show up in battles for a few decades even after they fell out of favor."

 flagreatproject.6.t: "The Destruction of the Theodosian Walls"
 flagreatproject.6.d: "The Theodosian walls were built many centuries ago first during the reign of Theodosius II during the years of 408-450, and were nearly impossible to breach for about 800 years. A few times during those 800 years the city almost fell, but it never fully fell to an outside force until 1204 by the Crusaders on the Fourth Crusade. They were rebuilt after the defenses were breached, however historically they would not hold a second attack when they suffered severe damage in 1453 from an Ottoman siege. Now the walls have finally fallen to a siege from the outside, and in the year [GetYear] the walls of Constantinople have finally fallen, perhaps for the last time. The Eastern Roman Empire is on the verge of extinction, after so many years."
 flagreatproject.6.a: "We're vulnerable! Quick, send men into the breach!"
 flagreatproject.7.t: "The Popularity of Cannons over Traditional Siege Equipment"
 flagreatproject.7.d: "With the rise in popularity of cannons instead of older fashioned siege equipment such as the Trebuchet a weakness in traditional castles has been found. Most 'modern' cannons can quickly and easily blast a hole in traditional castles, causing a need for new defenses to be created, and soon. This however will cause a handful of major defenses across the globe to become worthless, making those nations vulnerable for the first time in centuries."
 flagreatproject.7.a: "A new era is upon us!"
 flagreatproject.8.t: "The Completion of the new Theodosian Walls"
 flagreatproject.8.d: "After the destruction of the Theodosian walls previously, we've managed to gather enough resources to rebuilt them again! They may not be as powerful as they once were but at least having the walls should discourage all but the most ambitious attack."

 1356policyevents.51.d: "While our Diplomats typically are trained and sent to far away courts to appease various Kings and Queens this isn't always the case. A few of our diplomats in their free time have been going from court to court locally trying to appease the local Dukes, Counts, and Barons under our rule. It seems to have paid off as we now have the opportunity to offer them a 'deal' in order to gain more of their loyalty..."

 1356policyevents.101.d: "While the policy of Mandatory service of every male between the ages of 16-35 may be an easy way to keep our armies fully stocked by no means is it a good policy to keep around in times of peace. Peasants do not like their family being taken away from them without reason, and right now there is no justified reason to take their family away from them. Perhaps we can send some of their family home and pocket some extra taxes this year before we get a revolt?"

This would be a once in a lifetime opportunity to transform this loose confederation of tribes into a kingdom like the ones in Europe! Though some would argue that the old ways are better, and that the ways of Europe would corrupt our traditions. The king is deep in thought."

The Chinese used many bombs in historic accounts, however many of them were against the Mongols. During the seige of the Jin capital in 1232 the Jin used the 'Heaven-Shaking-Thunder bomb' against the Mongol invaders. It was an iron vessel filled with gunpowder which was lit on fire and shot off. It gets its name from the sound it makes when it goes off, and was said to turn men to ash instantly. "

They possess weapons that we do not, and have strategists that would best ours, yet we have the more skilled riders. If we were to work together and supplement each others strengths perhaps we could outlast the incoming onslaught. While this Confederation is long gone its memory still exists in our tribal leaders, and our tribal leaders yearn for the day they are able to replicate anything our ancestors may have done."
 CUM_idea_5: "Skilled Traders"

If we are to rise again as a peoples we must once again become skilled traders!"

 CUM_idea_7: "Caravan Riders"
 CUM_idea_7_desc: "We're experts at raiding caravans, trade routes, and merchants.

If we send riders ahead of the caravan and riders after the caravan we can screen the route ahead for hostiles and waste as little time as possible."
