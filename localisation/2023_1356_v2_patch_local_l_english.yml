 serbiancollapse.1.d: "Following the death of Stefan Uros IV Dusan and the ascension of Stefan Uros V to the throne, Serbia has seen its influence greatly diminish. While Uros IV was a proven ruler, modernizing and reforming the empire, Uros V has instead proven to be an incapable ruler. In recent months, Simeon Uros (Uncle to Uros IV), has consolidated his power base in Epirus and proclaimed himself ‘Emperor of Serbs and Greeks’ and now wages outright Civil War against us.\n\n Even if Simeon Uros is dealt with, we must contend with other Serbian noble families if the empire is to survive."
