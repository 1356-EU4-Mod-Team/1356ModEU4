To pass a reform, you'll need to take the reform's decision first. Each member of the League will then choose to either support or oppose the reform. To have a better chance of the other members supporting your reform, improve relations with them. Next, two new decisions will appear: Pass Reform and Cancel Reform. Cancel Reform will simply cancel the pending reform, and allow you to attempt to pass it again at a later date. Pass Reform will actually enact it. If you pass the reform, the members that opposed it will get a -100 opinion penalty with you, and you will not be able to pass another reform for 30 years. Reform 1 gives a -10% build cost reduction. Reform 2 gives -25 regiment cost reduction and 10% manpower recovery speed increase. Reform 3 gives you 1 diplomatic reputation. Passing Reform 4 will let each member either become your vassal or leave the League. Reform 5 makes every member leave the Empire, and finally Reform 6 unifies the League under its current ruler."

 flavor_fla_fra.1.d: "In the year 1349 Humbert II of Viennois sold Dauphine to King Phillip VI of France for 400,000 Écus 'Coin' and an annual pension. Humbert had already proven himself incompitent and extravagant, so in order to preserve his bruised ego it was called a Transfer. In order to prevent Dauphine from fading into just another title under the French King's belt he passed the 'Delphinal Staute.' This made Dauphine exempt from many taxes and gave it a higher degree of autonomy than other french dukes and crown counties. Now the time has come to integrate Dauphine fully into our nation. Historically Louis XI administered his territory directly in Dauphine, and fully integrated Dauphine into France when he became King. He lifted the state from near anarchy and developed the province. Now we have the choice, do we follow Louis XI's route and make Dauphine fully integrated with some exceptions from typical state duties, or do we forceably integrate them with no care for the population?

It was night when this remedy was administered. One of the female attendants of the palace, chgarged to sew up the cloth that contained the patient, came having come to the neck, the fixed point where she was to finish her seam, made a not according to custom; but as there was there was still remaining an end of the thread, instead of cutting as usual with scissors, she had recourse to the candle, which immediately set fire to the whole cloth. Being terrified, she ran away, and abandoned the king, who was thus burnt alive in his own palace\" -The account of Francis Blagdon, in English, of 1801, Cassell's Illustrated History of England volume I. p. 406. \n\nThe King of Navarra died not only a horrific death, but was mocked by European nobility for the coming centuries, and in the end he never achieved his dream, retook the land he believed rightfully belonged to him, or even got the respect he desired."

Charlamagne told Charles II that he was his ancestor and Charles II should claim whats rightfully his. On waking up Charles II talked to his closest advisors and asked them to spend every waking minute searching for 'Proof' Charles II was decended from Charlamagne. While they did that, Charles took it on himself to have him and his dynasty march their way through Western Europe and conquer all the Kingdoms that once laid under Charlamagnes mighty empire. Even if Charles II wouldnt end up making it, he knew one of his family members would. And so today we celebrate the coronation of $MONARCH$ as the new $MONARCHTITLE$ of Francia!"

Alongside that he has promised to help bring back the Yuan Empire back to its former glory! \n\nThis man could very well be delisional from all his traveling across China alone, and may just make the situation worse! We also must not forget about how our Consort AND our Administration believes this man is corrupt and only has ill intentions. Whatever our choice may be, we should think long and hard about it."

 rus_independence.6.d: "Despite all unifying under a single cause, the Russian Principalities have been met by a resounding defeat by White Horde. In retaliation the Khan of the White Horde sent Mongol raiders into the lands of the Tatar Yoke, sacking the major cities in the area and leaving the lands devastated for the foreseeable future.

With the White Horde left in disaster, the minor Russian Principalities have pledged themselves as vassals to the Principality of $COUNTRY$, establishing $COUNTRY$ as the De facto leader in the region.

 flavor_1356_hab.1.t: "The Rudolfinische Hausordnung"
 flavor_1356_hab.1.d: "A set of rules made by Rudolf IV in case of his death without issue, the Rudolfinische Hausordnung states that upon his death his brothers Albert and Leopold shall rule Austria jointly. Of course, the two brothers are ambitious in their own right, and would not hesitate to devolve into quarrels over who gets what after Rudolf passes away. The rules are just a fail-safe, but perhaps abolishing these rules in favor of only one ruler could strengthen the Duchy as a whole in the worst case scenario."
 flavor_1356_hab.1.a: "We will have an heir long before the laws are necessary."
 flavor_1356_hab.2.t: "An Heir to the Throne"
 flavor_1356_hab.2.d: "The rumors of Rudolf's infertility have been disregarded, as a newborn babe fits the criteria to be the heir to the Austrian throne! As it turns out Rudolf's plan for an issueless succession are not necessary anymore, and can be safely discarded."

 flavor_1356_hab.3.t: "The Death of Duke Rudolf"
 flavor_1356_hab.3.d: "Rudolf has passed away, and the law declares that Austria will pass to both his brothers to be jointly ruled. Whether this lasts or breaks down into chaos has yet to be seen. However, we must press on and survive this new transition as we have with all incidents in the past. Austria will not fall to a petty succession crisis."
 flavor_1356_hab.3.a: "We will pull through this."
 flavor_1356_hab.4.t: "The Death of Duke Rudolf"
 flavor_1356_hab.4.d: "Rudolf has passed away, and the law states that Austria be inherited by only one heir. This change of rules caused waves of unrest among the nobles and particularly Rudolf's brothers, who see this as a direct attack on what was promised to them. Now with these rules changed, only one brother will receive the throne, and the other will likely rebel if he does not get his way."
 flavor_1356_hab.4.a: "The inheritance goes to Albert."

 flavor_1356_hab.5.d: "The city of Freiburg is near our original holdings in Swabia, and rumor has it that the ruling count may be willing to make a deal with us to sell the city. We ought to send them a delegation of ducats to buy it; after all, who can resist our Habsburg charm? The city will fit nicely with our current Swabian holdings."

 flavor_1356_hab.6.t: "An Austrian Delegation"
 flavor_1356_hab.6.d: "The Austrians have come to our count with a large sum of ducats, asking for the right to own Freiburg and its surrounding area. This purchase of land would increase Austrian power in Swabia, but would also put us on good terms with the Habsburgs. We must choose between decreasing our own power for Habsburg friendship or maintaining Freiburg at the risk of Habsburg resentment."

 flavor_1356_hab.8.t: "Count of Freiburg Refuses"
 flavor_1356_hab.8.d: "The Count of Freiburg has refused to sell the province to us - likely out of self preservation. The estates have deliberated that the province is too important to give up, and so have claimed that it should be under Habsburg control regardless. King [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been urged to seize it by force, so a war may be brewing."

Having come to their senses, they have decided to split the Duchy of Austria into Austria and Styria, with Albert ruling the former and Leopold the latter. The Treaty of Neuburg also dictates that Leopold hold Anterior Austria, the Swabian provinces. Hopefully this settlement will allow the Habsburgs to continue to survive."
