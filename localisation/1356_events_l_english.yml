To pass a reform, you'll need to take the reform's decision first. Each member of the League will then choose to either support or oppose the reform. To have a better chance of the other members supporting your reform, improve relations with them. Next, two new decisions will appear: Pass Reform and Cancel Reform. Cancel Reform will simply cancel the pending reform, and allow you to attempt to pass it again at a later date. Pass Reform will actually enact it. If you pass the reform, the members that opposed it will get a -100 opinion penalty with you, and you will not be able to pass another reform for 30 years. Reform 1 gives a -10% build cost reduction. Reform 2 gives -25 regiment cost reduction and 10% manpower recovery speed increase. Reform 3 gives you 1 diplomatic reputation. Passing Reform 4 will let each member either become your vassal or leave the League. Reform 5 makes every member leave the Empire, and finally Reform 6 unifies the League under its current ruler."

 flavor_fla_fra.1.d: "In the year 1349 Humbert II of Viennois sold Dauphine to King Phillip VI of France for 400,000 Écus 'Coin' and an annual pension. Humbert had already proven himself incompitent and extravagant, so in order to preserve his bruised ego it was called a Transfer. In order to prevent Dauphine from fading into just another title under the French King's belt he passed the 'Delphinal Staute.' This made Dauphine exempt from many taxes and gave it a higher degree of autonomy than other french dukes and crown counties. Now the time has come to integrate Dauphine fully into our nation. Historically Louis XI administered his territory directly in Dauphine, and fully integrated Dauphine into France when he became King. He lifted the state from near anarchy and developed the province. Now we have the choice, do we follow Louis XI's route and make Dauphine fully integrated with some exceptions from typical state duties, or do we forceably integrate them with no care for the population?

Word has it the Elder van Vladderen has arranged a marriage between his first son and a nearby royal family. Now the locals are basically worshiping them like some sort of weird cult. It's only made worse by the fact that the Elder van Vladderen is claiming to be a decendent of a distant relative of ours that stole the throne from their mutual relative of ours! The peasants are now up in arms and may revolt if we do not act fast. Perhaps it may be safer for us to step down before we are killed in our own castle? "

We gave them a large sum of Ducats, promising that and more if they stayed loyal during these hard times, and they accepted. \n\nNow however, they want the other half of the money, a large degree of Autonomy, and for the Emperor himself to invest significant time and energy into the Nomadic Tribes! This will be very expensive obviously, however we may not be in a state to do this quite yet. The alternative is to tell them no and send them away, however then we're surely to get a massive nomadic rebellion to our north, and after the fighting we just went through our army is in no shape to wage another war on our own people! \n\nWell my [YUA.Monarch.GetTitle], what shall it be?"

However in 1354 the Emperor's Consort Lady Ki convinced the Emperor and his court Toqto'a was corrupt and had plans to overthrow him, so he was thus exiled into Yunan. Historically he was poisoned by assassin's on January 10th, 1356. \n\nHowever, somehow between 1354 and 1356 Toqto'a escaped far into the Mongolian steppes and bided his time until he believed he could return to Court and rescue the failing Yuan Empire. He traveled alone across Mongolia into the Emperors court in [YUA.Capital.GetName] to offer his services to [YUA.Monarch.GetName] and crush the rebellion before it crushes the remains of the Yuan Empire. Alongside that he has promised to help bring back the Yuan Empire back to its former glory! \n\nThis man could very well be delisional from all his traveling across China alone, and may just make the situation worse! We also must not forget about how our Consort AND our Administration believes this man is corrupt and only has ill intentions. Whatever our choice may be, we should think long and hard about it."

Our sources are unable to tell us if Toqto'a is really plotting to overthrow us, or if the Nobility are plotting against us. All we know is to keep our guard up from here on out."

They are upset that a man who could be corrupting their Emperor and usurping his throne is back in the court! They fear for the safety of you my [Yua.Monarch.GetTitle]! \n\nHowever it is to be kept in mind we've seen Toqto'a do absolutly nothing to show us he could be plotting against you my [YUA.Monarch.GetTitle]! He has not only saved your Empire from fadding into the Halls of History, but he has restored it to its former glory! We should be thanking him not calling him out!"

Having come to their senses, they have decided to split the Duchy of Austria into Austria and Styria, with Albert ruling the former and Leopold the latter.
