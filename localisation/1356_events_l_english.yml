 hansa.9.d: "Hansa reforms work much like Imperial reforms in the HRE. There are six in total, and they can only be passed by the current leader of the Hanseatic League. To pass a reform, you'll need to take the reform's decision first. Each member of the League will then choose to either support or oppose the reform. To have a better chance of the other members supporting your reform, improve relations with them. Next, two new decisions will appear: Pass Reform and Cancel Reform. Cancel Reform will simply cancel the pending reform, and allow you to attempt to pass it again at a later date. Pass Reform will actually enact it. If you pass the reform, the members that opposed it will get a -100 opinion penalty with you, and you will not be able to pass another reform for 30 years. Reform 1 gives a -10% build cost reduction. Reform 2 gives -25 regiment cost reduction and 10% manpower recovery speed increase. Reform 3 gives you 1 diplomatic reputation. Passing Reform 4 will let each member either become your vassal or leave the League. Reform 5 makes every member leave the Empire, and finally Reform 6 unifies the League under its current ruler."

 flavor_fla_fra.1.d: "In the year 1349 Humbert II of Viennois sold Dauphine to King Phillip VI of France for 400,000 Écus 'Coin' and an annual pension. Humbert had already proven himself incompitent and extravagant, so in order to preserve his bruised ego it was called a Transfer. In order to prevent Dauphine from fading into just another title under the French King's belt he passed the 'Delphinal Staute.' This made Dauphine exempt from many taxes and gave it a higher degree of autonomy than other french dukes and crown counties. Now the time has come to integrate Dauphine fully into our nation. Historically Louis XI administered his territory directly in Dauphine, and fully integrated Dauphine into France when he became King. He lifted the state from near anarchy and developed the province. Now we have the choice, do we follow Louis XI's route and make Dauphine fully integrated with some exceptions from typical state duties, or do we forceably integrate them with no care for the population?

It's only made worse by the fact that the Elder van Vladderen is claiming to be a decendent of a distant relative of ours that stole the throne from their mutual relative of ours!

We gave them a large sum of Ducats, promising that and more if they stayed loyal during these hard times, and they accepted. \n\nNow however, they want the other half of the money, a large degree of Autonomy, and for the Emperor himself to invest significant time and energy into the Nomadic Tribes! This will be very expensive obviously, however we may not be in a state to do this quite yet. The alternative is to tell them no and send them away, however then we're surely to get a massive nomadic rebellion to our north, and after the fighting we just went through our army is in no shape to wage another war on our own people! \n\nWell my [YUA.Monarch.GetTitle], what shall it be?"

However in 1354 the Emperor's Consort Lady Ki convinced the Emperor and his court Toqto'a was corrupt and had plans to overthrow him, so he was thus exiled into Yunan. Historically he was poisoned by assassin's on January 10th, 1356. \n\nHowever, somehow between 1354 and 1356 Toqto'a escaped far into the Mongolian steppes and bided his time until he believed he could return to Court and rescue the failing Yuan Empire. He traveled alone across Mongolia into the Emperors court in [YUA.Capital.GetName] to offer his services to [YUA.Monarch.GetName] and crush the rebellion before it crushes the remains of the Yuan Empire. Alongside that he has promised to help bring back the Yuan Empire back to its former glory! \n\nThis man could very well be delisional from all his traveling across China alone, and may just make the situation worse! We also must not forget about how our Consort AND our Administration believes this man is corrupt and only has ill intentions. Whatever our choice may be, we should think long and hard about it."

Our sources are unable to tell us if Toqto'a is really plotting to overthrow us, or if the Nobility are plotting against us. All we know is to keep our guard up from here on out."

They are upset that a man who could be corrupting their Emperor and usurping his throne is back in the court! They fear for the safety of you my [Yua.Monarch.GetTitle]! \n\nHowever it is to be kept in mind we've seen Toqto'a do absolutly nothing to show us he could be plotting against you my [YUA.Monarch.GetTitle]! He has not only saved your Empire from fadding into the Halls of History, but he has restored it to its former glory! We should be thanking him not calling him out!"

 yuanredturban.1.d: "The Red Turban Rebellion actually began in 1351, and ended in 1368 with the Fall of the Yuan Dynasty and the rise of the Ming Dynasty. Historically the Yuan Historian/General Toqto'a had almost squashed the Red Turban Rebellion a few years before we begin, however he was exiled by the Emperor for fear of betrayal. Now the Red Turbans are back in full force, and many who once followed Toqto'a have switched sides. \n\nThe Red Turban Rebellion is in full swing, and the fate of the Yuan Dynasty hangs in the balance. It can only be saved through a series of reforms that will change the fate of Yuan forever, but can it be done?"

There are obviously no other Kings of Poland but us! \n\nThe Peasants are strangly enjoying this odd man, while they are not listening to him many are finding amusement out of him! Children can now been seen following him around town singing the strange songs he's been singing dancing the odd dance that goes with it! \n\n'Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me, I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed...' \n\nMany peasants find it cute, and gives them more time alone, however there are a growing amount of people in court who think this man is nothing but trouble.

They will at first seem friendly, but they will only have foul intentions! If you are not careful then this will be the begining of the end!' Boomed the strange voice. \n\nThe Head Priest said to [ROOT.Monarch.GetTitle] [ROOT.Monarch.GetName], as he repeated the events as they unfolded to the [ROOT.Monarch.GetTitle]. The priest is visibly trembling and his face is pale. The rest of the soldiers in the room turn pale as the priest finishes, and the whole room gets silent. Suddenly a voice from the ceiling speaks in a deep booming voice. \n\n'[ROOT.Monarch.GetName], you must prepare and heed the word of your Head Priest. A large army from a faraway land will soon arive, they will seemingly have good intentions but they only wish to kill your subjects, burn your land, and steal your valuables. Heed my word! If you properly follow my orders then I will send aid to you so that you may be properly prepared! This will be your final warning!' Boomed the voice in the sky. \n\nThe voice stops, and the room grows louder as the soldiers whisper to eachother. '[ROOT.Monarch.GetName], you have a choice. What shall it be? I will send word to your vassals and generals to prepare if you wish it!' Spoke the Head Priest."

Some of our most trusted advisors find this man amusing, and think he is joking. However there are also others that agree with him, and think what he's saying may be right.

However with recent events this will never occur again, as a great fight broke out in the town of Alexandria. Thousands of Copts and Arabs alike were killed, with it all ending in a great fire. \n\nMany remaining Copts have fled south of Egypt, into the neighboring coptic nations south of Egypt. Only time will tell if the Copts will be able to recover from this tragedy."
