 ## Events
 WarTwoPetersFlavor.1.d: "Originally a war Orchestrated by Peter (Pedro) d’Ivree to seize the Kingdom of Valencia from Aragon, the War of Two Peters quickly escalated into a Civil war between King Peter and his Bastard brother, Enrique de Trastamara.The conflict would also earn the interest of the French and English Kings, with eventually both sides receiving support from one of the aforementioned Kingdoms."
 WarTwoPetersFlavor_new.1.a.tt: "Provinces owned by Trastamara and Castile will be annexed on sieging them down, the Civil War will end and the opposing faction will be annexed when one side has accrued a significant advantage in Warscore. When occupying a Province belonging to ether faction, it will be instantly looted." 
 WarTwoPetersFlavor_new.2.a.tt: "Valencia will be released and fall under Castilian Personal union"
 WarTwoPetersFlavor_new.3.a.tt: "If Peter loses the Castilian War of Succession, Portugal will likely not have healthy relations with the new Trastamara dynasty."

 collapse_of_liaoyang.1.t: "Liaoyang, Yuan Administration in Manchuria"
 collapse_of_liaoyang.1.desc: "Since the fall of the Khitan Jin dynasty in 1234, the Jurchen tribes of Manchuria have since been under Mongol rule. While considered a fringe area of rule under the Yuan dynasty, it was still administered as part of the Province of Liaoyang. However, now as the blessing of the Mandate of Heaven slips further away from the Yuan dynasty, so does the ability for Yuan to effectively govern Liaoyang. There may come a time in the near future where Mongol administrators will be forced out by the rising Jurchen tribes."
 collapse_of_liaoyang.1.a: "Dark times lie ahead…"
 
 collapse_of_liaoyang.2.t: "Disintegration of Liaoyang"
 collapse_of_liaoyang.2.desc: "Following continued neglect by the Yuan dynasty, control over the Province of Liaoyang has rapidly collapsed. All across Liaoyang, Jurchen tribesmen are executing Yuan officials or are forced out by small scale revolts. Brigands and Bandits now ravage the countryside with little repercussion. What little fragments remained of Yuan rule in Liaoyang have all but been shattered."

 # Tooltips
 has_selected_idea_1: "Is at least Administrative Technology 2"
 collapse_of_liaoyang.tt: "Liaoyang starts as an Autonomous subject under Yuan, with the Red Turban Rebellion in full swing in China, resources used to previously govern Liaoyang have been diverted in hopes of restoring rule to China. Should Yuan continue to fracture past the year 1364, Liaoyang will cease to exist, being divided up into multiple Jurchen clans. The Goryeo dynasty in Korea may also take advantage of this crisis and invade. The remaining lands of Liaoyang that did not cede to the Jurchens will be divided amongst Brigands and Bandits. §YWhen this time comes, we will have the ability to play as one of the Jurchen Tribes or attempt to survive as a Bandit Tribe.§!"

 information_events.1.t: "Playing with High Feudal Policies"
 information_events.1.d: "In 1356, players are given access to an array of early game policies known as 'High Feudal Policies' designed to tailor their experience over the course of the next 100 years. While you can keep these policies active post embracing the renaissance, you will be unable to select new ones or replace old ones post 1450. Furthermore, a §R-1§! Possible Policies modifier will be imposed until all early game policies have been removed.\n\nMonarchies with the High Feudal Monarchy or Elective Feudal Monarchy Reform will be able to negate this penalty, but will remain with the inability to select new High Feudal Policies."

Reforms\n\n§YNon-Tribal§! and §YNon-Native nations§! that do not use these reforms will instead just recieve the §Gbonuses§! from the Decision."
