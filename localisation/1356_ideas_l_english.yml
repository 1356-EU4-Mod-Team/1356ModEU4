 alx_idea_2: "Ancient Egyptian Dynastic Ties"
 alx_idea_2_desc: "We might not know of anyone with dynastic ties to the Ancient Pharaohs but that doesn't mean the people know this! If we lie and claim our Dynasty has ties to the Ptolemaic Dynasty of old we shall gain massive respect with our population!"
 alx_idea_3: "The Royal Army"
 alx_idea_3_desc: "If we are to being Glory back to Egypt we'll need to have a strong Army that can stand on its own against any outside threat! Our nation holds such a high population we should be able to levy more peasants into the army than our neighbors, giving us an advantage over them."
 alx_idea_4: "The Bounty of The Nile"
 alx_idea_4_desc: "The Nile not only sustains our life, but it also sustains the life of many animals, and provides us the ability to aquire many resources we would otherwise be unable to reach! If we build a primitive transportation system along the nile we shall be able to aquire more resources faster!"
 alx_idea_5: "Religious Isolation"

 egy_idea_2_desc: "While the Peasants and Nobility may not know this, but we really are not the decendants of the Pharaohs! If we keep this charade up long enough no one will be the wiser and know otherwise! We'll slowly brainwash our population to be as loyal as can be!"
 egy_idea_3: "An Intimidating Navy"

 egy_idea_4_desc: "Historically many Nobles used a language different from the Commoners, if we are to decree it mandatory that the Nobility use [ROOT.GetGroupName] as their primary language then perhaps the commoners will slowly follow suit!

They have adapted rather quick, and are showing signs they can adapt with ease."

 ing_idea_2: "Imported Nobility"
 ing_idea_2_desc: "When our Nobility came here from Lithuania and the Baltics they brought along with them their own advisors and connections to those in their homeland. If we are smart we can use this to our advantage by offering these advisors a plot of land in exchange for a discounted rate in pay."
 ing_idea_3: "Ingrian Stability"
 ing_idea_3_desc: "The upside of having your nation centered around a wasteland that's baren of live save for a few stray tribes is your Kingdom ends up being more stable. Who'd want to revolt if they're freezing everytime they step outside, and would starve if they opposed the state?"

 ing_idea_4_desc: "With all the additional troops flocking to our banner from foreign lands, we've been able to focus our efforts on other things our armies may need, such as properly equipping our men with the correct gear. In order to ensure that everyone is properly equipped we have had to create inferior armor for our troops, however the difference between the old and new armor should not be noticeable enough to harm our own men."
 ing_idea_5: "Hostile Homeland"
 ing_idea_5_desc: "Our homeland is a hostile environment, if we wish to surivive against our stronger neighbors then we need to make use of every part of our land, and that means ensuring hostile armies have a harder time seiging our fortifications. Not to mention ensuring our supply lines are well stocked and protected, this should give us the edge we need against our foes!"
 ing_idea_6: "Foreign Diplomacy"
 ing_idea_6_desc: "Thanks to our connections with the Novgorodians and Lithuanians we are able to utilize some of their infrastructure in order to send our diplomats our in a more timely manner.

 ing_idea_7: "Winter Wasteland Siege Tatics"
 ing_idea_7_desc: "Our Generals have gotten very good at sieging thanks to the harshness of our homeland. Who'd want to siege a castle for 8 months in the cold frozen wasteland? No one! It serves as a great motivator for learning new tatics."

 asy_idea_2_desc: "While we may be Christians surrounded by a sea of Muslims that doesn't mean that we need to hate our neighbors. On the contrary, it is in our best interest to accept all of our neighbors for who they are, and only punish the ones who take hostile action against us."
 asy_idea_3: "Empire Builders"

 asy_idea_4: "Diplomatic Training"
 asy_idea_4_desc: "While we may tolerate all religions that still doesn't mean we are able to find friends in our diplomatically isolated state. If we wish to actually survive in this world we need to ensure our Diplomats are properly equipped to handle any situation, and maybe then we will be able to find an ally or two."
 asy_idea_5: "Culturally Isolated"
 asy_idea_5_desc: "While we currently accept all religions in our glorious nation we're currently less accepting of other cultures. It may do us well to utilize these other cultures in our great empire, as they can fill in jobs that we are unable to find someone to appoint to."
 asy_idea_6: "Prestious Empires"
 asy_idea_6_desc: "The Assyrian Empire may be an old empire, but its name is not yet forgotten to time. The remainder of the Romans, and the well educated noblemen of Europe and the Near East know very well of what our ancestors were capable of. We should use this knowledge to our benefit and allow these foreigners to continue thinking so highly of us."

 umi_idea_4: "Homogeneous Culture"
 umi_idea_4_desc: "While our Tribe may be obscure to those around us those who we rule know us only as benevolent overlords. After we conquer a region we work to integrate them into our Federation, and extend all rights to their peoples so we may be equal. This has proven to cause the newly subjugated tribes to quickly become part of our large homogeneous group."
 umi_idea_5: "Army Loyalty"
 umi_idea_5_desc: "Our quick integration of tribes allows us to recruit more troops faster than other Kingdoms around us, which allows us to have a much larger size force compared to other Kingdoms of equal size. Not only that, but these troops are fiercely loyal to the Federation, ensuring that they will not revolt against us."
 umi_idea_6: "Ferocity in the face of Danger"
 umi_idea_6_desc: "While some Kingdoms armies may feel distraught at watching their fallen countrymen ours only feel empowered! If one soldier sees his friend die infront of him he only wishes to avenge his fallen friend, ensuring our armies continued ferocity even in the face of grave danger."
 umi_idea_7: "Integrate the Eastern Tribes"
 umi_idea_7_desc: "The land to our East is mostly untouched, and while a few small tribes may occupy the area currently it'd be in our best interest to occupy the region and integrate their tribes into our society.

 mrd_idea_2: "Rough Fighters"
 mrd_idea_2_desc: "Our troops are used to fighting under the roughest of circumstances, uphill, in a swamp, during the winter, low food supplies, ect. So when our troops come under fire from the enemy they are more than ready to stand their ground and fight, as they know if they win this battle there shall be plenty to eat!"
 mrd_idea_3: "Unified Tribal Administration"
 mrd_idea_3_desc: "Our unified Tribal Administrations have the ability to solve problems many Monarchies and their courts can not. The lower overhead cost of paying advisors allows us to direct funds to more important areas."
 mrd_idea_4: "Harsh Terrain"
 mrd_idea_4_desc: "While the harsh terrain we as a tribe live in may have its downsides, its upside is that our troops are always hunting an animal, or fighting bandits. This allows them to keep them at their best training possible. Something that those French Knights would know nothing about!"
 mrd_idea_5: "Homeland Advantage"
 mrd_idea_5_desc: "Our people know our woods and swamps better than anyone else, so if a caravan has to venture through our homeland they come through us first as we can not only supply them with supplies for their travels but we can also lead them through the quickest and safest path!"
 mrd_idea_6: "Advantages of the Hunt"
 mrd_idea_6_desc: "Living in the harsh Steppe has its advantages, since most of our troops already have the clothes required to survive the harsh terrain we do need to give them armor to defend themselves, as they already wear it! By not needing to supply them with armor we can put more money towards quality weapons and save a little in the process!"
