 AQT_trade_power: "Key Trade Port"

Even the Turks have developed a taste for it, despite supposedly refraining from alcohol."

Known for their courage in battle, unpaid they lived and operated as raiders on the frontiers."
 generic_seljuq_marches_desc: "Many independent Turkmen beyliks existed already under the Sultanate of Seljuq as well, especially in border areas, in order to ensure safety against the Byzantine empire."
 generic_travelling_ozan_desc: "Ozans sing and play the saz, they continue the traditions of Yunus Emre, Kaygusuz Abdal and Pir Sultan. Thanks to these traveling bards many interesting stories and epics have thrived throughout the years. We should support them as they are a part of our culture."
 generic_legacy_seljiuqs_empire_desc: "From their homelands near the Aral Sea, the Seljuq Turks advanced in the 10th century first into Khorasan and then into mainland Persia before eventually conquering Anatolia. They established an empire later called the Great Seljuk empire and had profound effects on the Near East. We have grown strong enough to proclaim our state as the successor to this great empire of our forefathers. Rejoice!"
 ARM_stability_desc: "While under the King of England our administration learned many things about ruling a Duchy, and many laws that would be helpful to both us and our peasants. Let us use this experience for our betterment"
 ARM_agressive_expansion_desc: "While we were vassals under the King of England we managed to accumulate many claims on provinces bordering us, let us use this to our advantage and blame the English!"
 ARM_production_desc: "Rouergue is home to many hills, and hills tend to hide minerals! Let us start up new Mining Opperations in our hills to extract as many ores as possible!"
 ARS_trade_desc: "Our location in the Low Countries may be on the outskirts of it, but this doesn't mean we can't influence trade in the region! Let us send out additional merchants and increase funding to gather even more trade for ourselves!"
 ARS_production_desc: "The Low Countries are home to many various types of trade goods. Our main export is cloth, if we fund the expansion of our production facilities then we will be able to produce even more!"

 ALX_ideas_bonus: "Alexandrian Ambitions"
 alx_idea_1: "The Nile"
 alx_idea_1_desc: "The Nile has sustained life since nearly the begining of Human civilization. If we are to keep our population on the river then we'll be able to have better control over our population, and we'll be able to grow our population at a much higher rate than previously!"
 alx_idea_2: "Ancient Egyptian Dynastic Ties"
 alx_idea_2_desc: "We might not know of anyone with dynastic ties to the Ancient Pharaohs but that doesn't mean the people know this! If we lie and claim our Dynasty has ties to the Ptolemaic Dynasty of old we shall gain massive respect with our population!"
 alx_idea_3: "The Royal Army"
 alx_idea_3_desc: "If we are to being Glory back to Egypt we'll need to have a strong Army that can stand on its own against any outside threat! Our nation holds such a high population we should be able to levy more peasants into the army than our neighbors, giving us an advantage over them."
 alx_idea_4: "The Bounty of The Nile"
 alx_idea_4_desc: "The Nile not only sustains our life, but it also sustains the life of many animals, and provides us the ability to aquire many resources we would otherwise be unable to reach! If we build a primitive transportation system along the nile we shall be able to aquire more resources faster!"
 alx_idea_5: "Religious Isolation"
 alx_idea_5_desc: "Our nation is isolated in a sea of Muslims, with a large minority of our population being Coptics and Jewish we should focus on tolerating all religions equally so we may be able to keep our population in order."
 alx_idea_6: "Egyptian Administration"
 alx_idea_6_desc: "Ancient Egypt's ability to Administrate its realm was beyond its time. If we attempt to imitate what they did perhaps we can pull more resources together so we can better provide our administration what it needs."
 alx_idea_7: "A Pharaohs Navy"
 alx_idea_7_desc: "Ancient Egypt controlled its seas with power! If we want to prove to our people we intend to restore Egypt to its former glory we must cover everything! Let us alocate more sailors and resources to our navy, and perhaps we will be rewarded with an easy to maintain navy!"

 egy_idea_1: "The Nile"
 egy_idea_1_desc: "The Nile can sustain many more lives than normal rivers, with some support from our administration we can perhaps make the lives of those near the nile better, which may allow us to grow our population at a much higher rate!"
 egy_idea_2: "Claim Decendence of The Pharaohs"
 egy_idea_2_desc: "While the Peasants and Nobility may not know this, but we really are not the decendants of the Pharaohs! If we keep this charade up long enough no one will be the wiser and know otherwise! We'll slowly brainwash our population to be as loyal as can be!"
 egy_idea_3: "An Intimidating Navy"
 egy_idea_3_desc: "To defend our coast we must not only have a strong Navy, but it must be plentiful and large. If we can manage to import more wood at a cheaper cost then perhaps we can use this to build even more ships!"
 egy_idea_4: "Language of the Nobility"
 egy_idea_4_desc: "Historically many Nobles used a language different from the Commoners, if we are to decree it mandatory that the Nobility use [ROOT.GetGroupName] as their primary language then perhaps the commoners will slowly follow suit! This shall make it easier to convince them that the ways they follow are inferior to our own!"
 egy_idea_5: "Administrations of Old"
 egy_idea_5_desc: "The Pharaohs of old had a tight grip on their country, with their entire population and administration bowing to their every need and command! If we can streamline our administration while taking inspiration of Ancient Egypt then perhaps we can fit in a few extra royal decrees."
 egy_idea_6: "Blind Loyalty"
 egy_idea_6_desc: "To have an effective army that will never betray you, you need to convince them that you are the true and only ruler of Egypt! If we can manage this then not only will we get more recruits from the peasants, but we'll also be able to spot spies much easier!"
 egy_idea_7: "A Ferocious Army"
 egy_idea_7_desc: "While an army that is blindly loyal to you is useful, it means nothing if they are not trained. We should hire the best leaders in Europe to train our army so it can be on par with them!"

 cum_idea_1: "Strategic Looting"
 cum_idea_1_desc: "When Cumans are on then way to a target they do not loot along the way there, they wait until they are on the return trip and loot, pillage, and take as many slaves as possible."
 cum_idea_2: "The Cuman Ride"
 cum_idea_2_desc: "In order to make better time the Cumans ride through the night, their horses have feedbags, and they do not rest. They can travel 6 times the distance a normal army can in the same time."
 cum_idea_3: "Learn the New Ways"
 cum_idea_3_desc: "We were formerly a nomadic tribe in the Pontic Steppe that once ruled most of Tataria, however when other tribes came from the east they were slowly pushed out, and now all that remains is a small tribe in Carpathia. They have adapted rather quick, and are showing signs they can adapt with ease."
 cum_idea_4: "Adaption"
 cum_idea_4_desc: "We are far away from our homeland, and we have no way to return. We have no choice but to adapt to the region we've settled in and make it our new home. It will take time, but perhaps we can adapt to these odd customs slowly?"
 cum_idea_5: "Nomadic Roots"
 cum_idea_5_desc: "As former nomads we can take more than we came for, most people pay no attention and we can use this to our advantage. Let them overlook the small Tribe of Cumans, it shall be their downfall..."
 cum_idea_6: "Cuman Unity"
 cum_idea_6_desc: "There are few Cumans left, and we are all that there is. We must work together if we want our identity to survive."
 cum_idea_7: "Caravan Protection"
 cum_idea_7_desc: "All of the Trade Caravans we send out are protected with their own Calvary regiment, they are always on watch, and always ready for anything. This will allow us to make better time with our caravans in the future and perhaps these elite units may inspire the rest of our army!"
