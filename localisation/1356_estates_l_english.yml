 estate_nestorian: "Nestorian Minorities"
 estate_nestorian_desc: "Nestorian Minorities exist all across Asia, from Baghdad to Bejing. These minority groups are not very large, but they typically consist of well learned people, or those close to high ranking members of governments. They can make or break a nations government when it matters most if they are angered, however most Nestorians are content spreading the word of their lord and establishing communities in other nations."
 estate_zoroastrian: "Parsi Communities"
 estate_zoroastrian_desc: "Parsi Communities are Persian Zoroastrians who fled Persia during the 8th century and beyond. Many of these Parsis left their homeland for Gujarat, where they integrated quickly with local customs. These people want nothing more than to be accepted among the rest of the local populace. These minorities when pleased will aid greatly in growing cities and their trade. However when angered they may rise up to establish their own independent state, or if nothing else they will disrupt governing in many local cities."
