 QOTN_NAME: "The Queen in the North"
 QOTN_DESC: "Margaret I, was Queen of Denmark, Norway and Sweden and founder of the Kalmar Union, which united the Scandinavian countries for over a century. On the 23rd of August 1387, Olav II of Norway and Denmark died unexpectedly at the age of 16, and Margaret was quick to secure herself as the 'all powerful lady and Queen Regent' of Denmark. The next year she was voted the same by the Nobles of Norway and finally in 1389 she was invited to take the throne of Sweden from Albert 'the German' by the rebelling Nobles. Scandinavia is there for the taking, but can you recreate her empire?\n§OThis Bookmark is currently not actively supported. Play at your own risk.§!"
 oi_name: "The Ottoman Interregnum"
 oi_desc: "The Ottoman Interregnum, or the Ottoman Civil War, began on 20 July 1402, when chaos reigned in the Ottoman Empire following the defeat of Sultan Bayezid I by the Central Asian warlord Timur. Although Mehmed Çelebi was confirmed as sultan by Timur, his brothers refused to recognize his authority. Today's date is 21st March 1405, and Timur draws his last breath. In the west, John the Fearless of Burgundy inherits the Duchy of Flanders from his mother and begins the ascension of the Grand Duchy of the West. The Byzantines, clinging to what little remains of their once sprawling empire, have a short respite, but can they take advantage of the situation and finally drive the Turks out of Europe?\n§OThis Bookmark is currently not actively supported.

 tt_name: "The Treaty of Troyes"
 tt_desc: "The Treaty of Troyes was an agreement that Henry V of England and his heirs would inherit the throne of France upon the death of King Charles VI of France. It was signed in the French city of Troyes on 21 May 1420 in the aftermath of the Battle of Agincourt. Whilst, officially, the war ended for a few months, fighting never ceased and the treaty was undermined by the deaths of both Charles VI and Henry V within two months of each other in 1422. It forms a part of the backdrop of the latter phase of the Hundred Years' War, in which various English kings tried to establish their claims to the French throne. \n§OThis Bookmark is currently not actively supported.

Eventually, after changing leadership a handful of times and rebellions merging into bigger groups Zhu Yuanzhang became the leader of the rebellion after Guo Zixing passed away. Zhu would go on to lead a campaign against the Yuan, and finally founding the Ming Dynasty in 1368 when he proclaimed himself Emperor. The whole rebellion lasted around 20 years, and every Yuan official that was captured by the Red Turbans was brutally murdered. /n/nThese rebels wish to gain freedom from Yuan oppression, and will stop at nothing to get it.
