BUGS REPORTED
Bug reported that sometimes at war AI may completly disband its entire army, perhaps related to the Hansa? Noted the reporter never seen this in vanilla. However it was noted the entire country was occupied when it happened, so perhaps not all that bad?
Bug where sometimes AI sits on 999 DIP power for some odd reason.
Chinese Events not working?
Yuan Rebel Events are buggy, look into
ALX Name Localisation not working
sevilla needs to switch to CAS if it fully annexes CAS/CAS ceases to exist
yuan should implode when it looses the mandate, not continue to exist
Age Bonus of Feudalism Revolt Risk not working, need to add code somewhere thats missing.
Look into Iberia, it looks Broken again.
Look into Yuans religion missions, may be unbalanced now
France needs nerf?
random nations still receiving "The Massacure of Alexandria" event. FIX.
Naples does not start with its capital in naples
Look into Muslim Spread into Indonesia events
Charles of Navarra doesnt exist
Developing a province then going to the Age Bonuses Menu Crashes the game. (Both Times developed their capital)

TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER
"In 1361 The County of Savoy was detached dejure from the Kingdom of Arles, in 1388 it aquired Nice, and in 1401 it added the County of Geneva. In 1416 it became its own independent duchy, "
"More fortunate was a dynasty – if such it may be termed – to the west of them, at Sabzawār. This was the Sarbadārs (a name which means “heads on gallows”), who were an independent power from 736/1336 to 783/1381 and thereafter tributaries, with their power much reduced, of Temür. The Sarbadār state was a revolutionary Shīʿī polity without effective dynastic succession. It has been interpreted in various ways. A Marxist historian like I. P. Petrushevsky sees it as the result of a popular movement of social protest, essentially a peasant uprising against “feudal” oppression. J. M. Smith, by contrast, prefers to explain the establishment of the Sarbadār state as deriving from a revolt by the upper classes of the region against taxes they found objectionable. Whatever the truth of the matter, there is no denying the lower-class and, in some sense, the revolutionary element in what was going on." Something about a Persian Peasant Republic
Investigate North Africas Culture Further
Investigate the Cultural Situation in Russia better, none of this can be right at the current date..
Investigate Styrian culture and find out if/when it was distinct from Austrian Culture & If needed create events for it to spawn/go away
Investigate Avarian Culture further, should it be added?
Investigate Iberian Cultures, it has to be somewhat different at this date?
Investigate Nestorians further, where should they exist?
Investigate Arabian Cultures further, are they any different in this date?
Investigate if the Hussites are not crushed in time what should happen. (Crusade Mechanics? Generic Heresys growing and becoming actual religions? Forcing the Protestants out even earlier?)
A way to add Paitriarch mechanics for Christians?
vanilla coptic events - investigate further


Add/Change later
Tribes Estate?
Byz Cores in Greece need reworked
Library of Alexandria needs a model #I TRIED BUT ITS NOT WORKING! Game registers its finished, but the province modifier & Model dont appear.
