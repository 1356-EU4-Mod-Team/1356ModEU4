V27B

Missions
- Added the Zurich Mission Tree (Victoria) 

Flavor
- Ideas for all the Swiss Minors
- Removed Generic Swiss Ideas, in turn all Swiss Minors have their own ideas
- Removed Generic Armenian Ideas, they were unused and duplicates anyways
- Added a random option to the Timur spawn event, which aims to give Timur his own ability to conquest with less help than the historical path. Will he go into China embracing their ideals? Will he create the next Steppe Empire? Or will he just do the same damn thing as always?
- All the Timur invasion events have a fallback option in the case that the nation being invaded does not actually exists, this should prevent annexing nation X to prevent timur conquesting bugs.

Balance
- Sami received its 7th idea that it was missing previously?
- Timur's historical war declerations are now reversed. The nations he's invading actually declare the war, which should prevent them from calling in allies, which should allow Timur to mostly follow his historical path.
- Players who are invaded by Timur now see the Timur death mark modifier on their nation. (It gives them a fighting chance)
- The Timur death mark modifier now gives -2 revolt risk
- Germany can now use the Prussian Monarchy if formed while holding the Prussian Monarchy

AARONS PERSONAL NOTES

TO DO
Make Egypts Custom Flag better
Crusader States should be able to ask for help from Catholics at home (Dip Action)
Events for Timur to kill Assyrians
Misc Assyrian Flavor events
Jan Zizka Related Event (Hussite General)
Library of Alexandria needs National Modifiers for the nation that owns it (as opposed to a province modifier)
Unless noted otherwise all new cultures need their names looked at and tweaked, as they're all reskins of existing cultures.
Give Arpitan culture its own provinces & Change Provences+Savoys+Dauphine cultures to this. Modify existing Arles formation to take these into account.
Give Moravian culture its own provinces + Modify Moravia to use this culture
Add Cummania
fucking fix india you savage
Expand on existing Zoroastrian Flavor
switch duchy to state for the Coptic government localisation?
"Patriarchate of Alexandria" would be awesome should they turn into a theocracy too
crusader culture should be outremer


TEST
-Test the New Egyptian (Coptic/Non Muslim) related Naming System for Rulers

Egypts Response to how to deal with the Copts should be Global
Chinese Events not working?
Yuan Rebel Revolts are global
Yuan Rebel Events are buggy, look into
Coptic Event that converts ALX to Coptic should also swap culture (Its set to, but it doesnt??)

TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER
"In 1361 The County of Savoy was detached dejure from the Kingdom of Arles, in 1388 it aquired Nice, and in 1401 it added the County of Geneva. In 1416 it became its own independent duchy, "
"More fortunate was a dynasty – if such it may be termed – to the west of them, at Sabzawār. This was the Sarbadārs (a name which means “heads on gallows”), who were an independent power from 736/1336 to 783/1381 and thereafter tributaries, with their power much reduced, of Temür. The Sarbadār state was a revolutionary Shīʿī polity without effective dynastic succession. It has been interpreted in various ways. A Marxist historian like I. P. Petrushevsky sees it as the result of a popular movement of social protest, essentially a peasant uprising against “feudal” oppression. J. M. Smith, by contrast, prefers to explain the establishment of the Sarbadār state as deriving from a revolt by the upper classes of the region against taxes they found objectionable. Whatever the truth of the matter, there is no denying the lower-class and, in some sense, the revolutionary element in what was going on." Something about a Persian Peasant Republic
Investigate North Africas Culture Further

Scanian culture?
Didnt norway historically have a colony in beothuk at this date?
Investigate if the Hussites are not crushed in time what should happen. (Crusade Mechanics? Generic Heresys growing and becoming actual religions? Forcing the Protestants out even earlier?)
