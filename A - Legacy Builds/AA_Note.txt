To save my sanity, all versions are noted as working in the LATEST VERSION that they do not crash in. This may mean that some earlier builds are actually intended for different builds.
So you may need to jump around versions and try new things.

GENERAL NOTES:

I may have missed a version or two, so if a version of the mod acts weird in one version, try a version up or down to see if its solved. I'm unsure whats intended to go where.

CRASH NOTES:

In 1.6, 1.7, and 1.8 versions of the mod I noticed the game crashing when mousing over Tibet's Noble Republic Government.
