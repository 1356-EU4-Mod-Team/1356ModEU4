Legacy Builds & Previous Builds

LEGACY BUILDS
The Legacy builds contain ALL of the builds DanJonMin gave us of 1356 prior to us taking over the project. They are not labled per their version, and we as a team do NOT support them.

PREVIOUS BUILDS
Previous builds start at V25, and then V27, then V29. 26/28 were lost, and since then we try harder to keep better track of our builds. We only support the active build of 1356, however its not impossible for us to provide support to previous builds.
