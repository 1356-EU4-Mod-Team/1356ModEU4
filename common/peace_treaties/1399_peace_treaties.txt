# Completely scripted peace treaties are made here

# THIS is the Taker and FROM the Giver in all scopes unless otherwise stated

# This functionality was made to fully support modded subject types. It can probably also be used for other things, but has the following limitations:
# These treaties don't support having a different Taker/Giver than the two countries that are negotiating.
# Nor do they support setting provinces (like cede province) or third party countries (like annull treaties) as targets.

# Example:


end_sound_toll = {
	category = 6
	power_projection = 5
	power_cost_base = 1.0
	prestige_base = 0.1
	ae_base = 1.0
	requires_demand_independence = no
	is_make_subject = no
	requires_is_allowed = no

	is_visible = {
		NOT = { has_global_flag = has_dismantled_hansa }
		FROM = { tag = HSA }
	}
	is_allowed = {
		owns = 12
	}
	effect = {
		12 = {
			owner = {
				remove_country_modifier = hansa_sound_toll
			}
		}
		set_country_flag = ended_sound_toll
	}
	ai_weight = {
