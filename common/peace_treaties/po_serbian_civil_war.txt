# Completely scripted peace treaties are made here

# THIS is the Taker and FROM the Giver in all scopes unless otherwise stated

# This functionality was made to fully support modded subject types. It can probably also be used for other things, but has the following limitations:
# These treaties don't support having a different Taker/Giver than the two countries that are negotiating.
# Nor do they support setting provinces (like cede province) or third party countries (like annull treaties) as targets.

# Example:


po_claim_the_serbian_empire = { # Thessaly Peace Deal
